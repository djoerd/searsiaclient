{"description":"Welcome to NLnet Foundation When it comes to important ideas that can help improve our society, there really are no boundaries. The challenge is to turn those opportunities into reality. Great ideas just come, but they are gone in a breeze as well. Lets make good use of them. Since 1997 NLnet foundation has been financially supporting organizations and people that contribute to an open information society. It funds those with ideas to fix the internet. The procedure is fast, competitive and open to anyone. NLnet has contributed funding to many important and very visible projects around fundamental standards from securing the core routing protocols and the domain name system of the internet to safer email, vendor-independent videoconferencing, more reliable wireless networks and private instant messaging - all based on open standards and verifiable open source software and/or hardware. It spawned the world-renowned NLnet Labs, and supported great open source projects like Jitsi, ARPA2, NoScript, Tor Hidden Services, GPLv3, GNUnet, Serval project, Binary Analysis Tool and webODF. And many more .... What is perhaps most amazing about this all is the size of NLnet. NLnet does not have huge budgets. The foundation's current funding comes from donations and legacies, after having been kickstarted by a substantial capital established by pioneers of the European internet. NLnet itself at the time was the very first Dutch Internet Service Provider, and transitioned into a recognised charity in 1997. The articles of association for the NLnet foundation state: \"to promote the exchange of electronic information and all that is related or beneficial to that purpose\". Do you have a great idea? Find out what NLnet can do for you Or if you want to support our work, help us without paying a cent. Or read what some really interesting people say about NLnet (and why you might consider donating some money).","url":"/","title":"Welcome to NLnet Foundation"},

{"url":"/realtime/","title":"Standards in real-time communication","description":"Standards in real-time communication NLnet wants to enable mankind to use the internet to its full potential. The internet is not only about services that you consume or information that you can read on the web, it is also increasingly the communication channel of choice between individuals and groups. We as humans use the internet to see and hear each other, exchange or broadcast messages, share content and keep each other posted about the things we care about. The internet is more and more a vehicle for our presence and for sharing our work and private life. There are many separate high-quality techologies and services available to do so, but development is significantly hindered by the fragmentation of the market. Where other internet technologies like email have achieved an industry wide adoption, the market seems unable to converge on real-time communication. That means that we have individual services that partly fulfil our needs, but lack a real common infrastructure to make it truly global. If we want to increase the role of the internet in our daily lives sustainably in this area, that means that we have to follow the model of the internet. In our vision that means standards-based, distributed (which means no single point of failure, including independence of individual vendors, security by design, and leveraging the unique global identities provided by the domain name system. Only that way everyone - from citizen to industry, from civil society to government - can trust this infrastructure. The Real-Time Communication fund hosted by NLnet foundation funds projects that bring these goals closer. The foundation focuses on technology development as well as creating awareness, and is actively pursuing standardisation in internet based communication and presence tools.

{"url":"/nren/","title":"Research and Higher Education Technology Fund","description":"Research and Higher Education Technology Fund \"Today we make the internet of tomorrow The vital role of academic and research institutions in the history of the internet is difficult to overestimate: from the earliest days of the ARPAnet the scientific and higher education community was at the very center of the technological development and helped push the boundaries of technology. Not just in the US, but everywhere around the world. NLnet itself saw the light at the national center for Mathematics in the Netherlands. As the internet grew step by step, much of the important work happened within this community. And it should be recognised that a lot of key work happened outside of the regular operational scope of organisations involved: universities and research institutes as well as individual researchers were able to contribute not because they were funded to do so, but because they were given enough freedom to deviate from their official tasks and do what needed to be done. The beautiful result is the internet: the largest communication infrastructure the world has ever built. More recently, financial cuts and the 'publish or perish' paradigm are increasingly impacting the capability of the research and education community to contribute. While the internet needs it more than ever, potential contributions and innovations 'for the greater good' now find themselves shelved - in some cases for ever. There is an allocation problem and real funding gap between the distributed talent and ideas in research and higher education, and the current financial possibilities that allow them to contribute. The Research and Higher Education Technology Fund was created to help fund small initiatives that can make a difference. The Fund is a collaboration between NLnet and the Vietsch foundation, which was set up by Karel Vietsch (1952-2014) through his last will and testament.

Een a twee keer per jaar wordt de lijst uitgebreid met extra software en nieuwe versies van bestaande software met additionele functionaliteit. Je hoort dat altijd vooraf. Wat | Hoe | Wie | Veelgestelde vragen | Nu meedoen | English Hoe zit het precies? OIN is bedoeld als een defensieve patentpool, opgezet om een zo breed mogelijke wapenstilstand af te dwingen rondom een aantal belangrijke opensource-projecten. Door een handtekening te zetten onder de licentie van OIN help je om de vrede te bewaren en de boodschap uit te dragen dat open source geen patentslagveld hoort te zijn. OIN beschermt een lijst met basale gratis software die we allemaal op een of andere manier direct of indirect wel ergens gebruiken - in vrijwel iedere smartphone, in online diensten, op onze desktops en servers, en (ongezien) in wifirouters, auto's en andere apparaten thuis, in kantoren en op de werkvloer. Samengevat: normale eindgebruikers en ontwikkelaars hebben geen enkele verplichting. De deelnemers die wel (software)patenten hebben, verlenen ( alleen aan elkaar ) gratis een wederkerige licentie om de betreffende bestaande open source software te mogen blijven gebruiken en verder te ontwikkelen natuurlijk. Daarbuiten blijft alles zoals het is. (lees de complete licentietekst ) Een dergelijke vredesverklaring klinkt misschien als onnodig, maar er zijn allerlei malafide bedrijfsmodellen rondom het uitmelken van soms heel vage patenten. In andere gevallen zijn rechtszaken deel van een bewuste strategie om de ontwikkeling van open source software te ontmoedigen. Je doet mee door online te registreren via de site (officieel wordt je dan 'licentie-nemer', net als dat je dat wordt als je bijvoorbeeld Java of LibreOffice op een computer installeert). Je krijgt dan kostenloos een onbeperkte licentie op alle technologie die OIN zelf in haar eigen brede portfolio heeft. Die patenten zijn speciaal aankocht voor een zo breed mogelijke dekking en deels ook gedoneerd door OIN-leden zoals Philips, Sony, IBM, Canonical, Google en RedHat. (Je kunt zelf trouwens ook patenten doneren als je die toevallig op de plank hebt liggen). Door OIN maakt je meteen deel uit van een internationaal juridisch netwerk dat patentagressie wil voorkomen.

John Dickinson, Fabio Erculiani, Brenno de Winter and Karsten Gerloff say about NLnet as well! There is a lot of value to society we get for free. Many important technologies, like the internet and the world wide web, are not owned by any single company or government. They are part of what makes our modern world run, yet you can't buy or own them. They were handed down to us, generously, by the people who created them. These pioneers had no business model in mind when they created the technologies we now use, and that made just about everything else that happened possible. A famous quote from Vint Cerf goes \"the internet is an experiment that never ended\". In order to keep that experiment running, we need to challenge and revisit our ideas continuously - and come up with new ones. And once we have what we think are the right ideas, we not only have to make sure they indeed are right but also that they don't fall between the cracks before they get deployed. Not every idea has a business model to back up its maturation, and outside of publicly funded and corporate research and development there are many important contributions to be made. That is where NLnet lives. The way NLnet works is as simple as it is effective: we invite smart people around the world to submit their ideas on improving the core technologies the internet runs on, and pick out the very best ideas for funding in a very fast and lightweight procedure. We don't care where the people that do our projects live or what they do. We don't demand new, market-ready stuff or a part of the profit. It doesn't have even to be glorious - sometimes there is much to learn about existing technologies as well - especially when they are broken. All we care about is supporting great ideas that help the internet. And it works. Over the years NLnet has been providing millions and millions worth of microgrants to many excellent projects, such as NoScript, TOR, Serval project, Unhosted, KSplice, GPLv3, NAT64, Jingle Nodes and many many more. In addition NLnet spawned NLnet Labs, one of the leading not-for-profit internet research labs that focuses on the security and robustness of commercially unattractive yet essential core internet technologies such as DNSSEC and BGP. All results are made fully available by these projects under recognised open source licenses. The internet is all about generous opportunities. With your donation we can keep on fueling new generations of talent around the planet, and keep the experiment running.

{"title":"SOS Internet","description":"SOS Internet Steunfonds Open en Stabiel Internet English translation Op 11 januari 2012 deed de rechtbank in Amsterdam een uitspraak die verstrekkende gevolgen heeft voor het internet zoals we dat in Nederland kennen. Internetaanbieders XS4all en Ziggo moeten het vanaf 1 februari 2012 hun gebruikers onmogelijk maken om bij een specifieke webcommunity (\"The Pirate Bay\") te komen. Een dergelijke blokkade heeft nogal wat implicaties - voortaan moet ieder internetpakketje dat via die providers wordt gestuurd bekeken worden of het niet van of naar een verboden bestemming leidt - met alle complexiteit en instabiliteit vandien. Daarmee worden alle Nederlandse gebruikers van het internet ernstig benadeeld - en niet alleen de bezoekers van de betreffende sites. Dat kan eigenlijk niet. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat met de juiste informatie in hoger beroep deze zaak afgewezen kan worden, maar dat gaat jaren duren. De zaak staat bovendien niet op zich: er wordt nu een tweede rechtszaak begonnen tegen KPN, UPC en T-Mobile. Brein heeft inmiddels ook andere Nederlandse ISP's aangeschreven, en heeft ruimschoots de middelen om in al die gevallen naar de rechter stappen. Het net wordt steeds wijder uitgegooid. Dat betekent een golf van rechtszaken tegen ook kleinere (en minder draagkrachtige) partijen - en het risico dat dat ergens behoorlijk fout gaat. De kans lijkt groot dat zonder ingrijpen straks voor iedereen in Nederland de kwaliteit en bruikbaarheid van het internet omlaag gaat. --> Dat moeten we niet laten gebeuren. Het gaat om een zaak die gevoerd wordt tegen internetproviders, maar zij zijn natuurlijk niet de enige belanghebbenden in dit proces. Iedereen in Nederland krijgt ongevraagd te maken met de uitkomsten van deze belangrijke rechtszaak, en dat kan veel schade aanrichten voor de samenleving - ook economisch. Daarom is het initiatief genomen om een speciaal steunfonds in te richten dat de belangen van internetgebruikers in deze juridische kwestie zal proberen te verdedigen. Met het opzetten van het fonds (met de toepasselijke titel 'Steunfonds Open en Stabiel Internet') willen we het mogelijk maken dat er voldoende geld beschikbaar is om in deze rechtszaken ook het geluid van tien miljoen Nederlandse internetgebruikers (en nog meer in de toekomst) te laten horen. We willen dat er geld is voor degelijk (wetenschappelijk) onderzoek en andere activiteiten die van nut zouden kunnen zijn bij deze rechtzaak. Het geld gaat niet naar de juridische verdediging van XS4all, Ziggo of een van de andere ISP's, maar naar onafhankelijke initiatieven vanuit de samenleving ten dienste van deze rechtszaken. SOS Internet wordt kostenloos professioneel beheerd door stichting NLnet, de charititatieve instelling die dertig jaar geleden de basis legde voor het internet zoals we dat nu in Nederland kennen. Beoordeling van de aanvragen geschiedt door een commissie onder leiding van Marleen Stikker (Waag Society), Simon Hania (oud-technisch directeur XS4all) en Hendrik Rood (Adviseur Internetarchitectuur en -technologie).

Once or twice a year new software and updated versions of existing software with additional functionality are added. You are always informed in advance. What | How | Who | Frequently asked questions | More info | Join now How does it work? OIN is meant as a defensive patent pool, created to grow a wide ring of peace around a number of important open source projects. By putting your signature under the license of OIN, you help to maintain non-aggression and convey the message that open source is not the right place to fight patent wars. OIN protects a set with basic free software that are omnipresent and used by almost everyone - as part of nearly every smartphone, underneath nearly every online service, as the basis of the software on our desktops and servers, in many different types of devices at home, in offices, on the road and even in space. What does it mean to sign up? The short summary: if you have (software) patents (which most people don't), you give out a free reciprocal licence to the other participants in order to be able to use and further develop existing open source software that is itself already available for free. Normal end users and developers without patents have no obligations whatsoever, yet profit from the protection against some forms of patent abuse. Outside of that, everything stays as it is. (read the complete licence text ) This type of peace treaty may sound superfluous, but there are all kinds of malevolent business models around exploiting sometimes extremely fuzzy software patents.

NLnet is officially recognised as a \"Public Benefit Organisation\" (Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling) by the Netherlands Tax authorities. Over the years NLnet has contributed financially to important projects to make the internet safer, more robust and privacy-friendly - like TOR, Jitsi, GNUnet, OpenBTS, Unbound, Unhosted and many more. NLnet enables independent developers and researchers from around the globe to work on a better future for the internet. Read what people like Roger Dingledine (project lead TOR), dr.

{"title":"Areas of special interest","url":"/themes/","description":"Areas of special interest NLnet funds a large diversity of projects that all somehow improve the internet, at many different levels - from software plumbing quality assuarance to core technical protocols. In areas of specific interest we also do put in additional effort and focus in order to increase the impact of projects even further. Current theme funds Internet Hardening Whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed a whole new dark dimension of the internet, where pervasive monitoring at a scale that was unimaginable is just the starting point of many other threats. In response, the IETF (the standards body behind the internet) firmly stated that it considers the internet to be \" under technical attack \". In other circumstances, one might want to drop the whole technology, but this is not easy because the internet has become a critical infrastructure for society. It is therefore vital to adequately adress that attack, and revisit the security and privacy properties of the internets underpinning standards. The Internet Hardening Fund is aimed at funding such efforts to help the internet forward- by improving its security, reliability and trustworthiness. By rewriting or replacing standards where necessary, and by make sure that those standards are actually deployed. more&nbsp;&gt; Real-time communication There are many separate high-quality techologies and services available for people to communicate across the internet live, but the development is significantly hindered by the fragmentation of the market.

{"description":"Open Document Format \"A disruptive technology in disguise\" The standardisation of the Open Document Format (ISO 26300:2006) took five years of hard work within OASIS. In 2006 the unanimous approval of this XML-based universal Office-format within the International Standards Organisation ISO meant a clear slope change point for innovation and market reach of open standards and open source in general. Governments, companies and individuals quickly recognised the enormous importance of having a way of encoding information that is truly portable across applications, operating systems and vendors as well as not having any problems crossing the barriers of time. ODF spawned a collective move away from company-dictated file formats that can only be adequately opened by a single application from a single vendor. We now understand that we want open standards that are oblivious with respect to the software used to generate or edit them. Good formats like ODF make global interoperability and the free flow of information a reality, which is a real breakthrough for the entire ICT world. The huge amount of active support ODF received from the IT industry itself --and from society at large too-- is a testimony to that fact. Society doesn't change overnight, although the pace is astounding. In the past twenty years the lack of a mature open standard for information exchange at the document level has caused a very unhealthy de facto monoculture with fallout well beyond the operating system and productivity software where things started. These negative consequences move far beyond the economic realm and range from an increased digital divide and innovation poverty to large-scale cyber criminality and botnets such as Storm that are able to almost push countries off the internet. A self-imposed social acceptance of closed formats is sometimes difficult to break through, but with the dominant binary formats of the past having been deprecated by their vendors themselves the situation looks very bright. The market has learned from the past, and with the file format decoupled from the applications there is no learning curve, a low cost of switching and most of all: an open market for innovation. And that is what we are seeing: great innovations taking place because people can move into the containers they were locked out for decades. Open Document Format is vendor independent and its proven technology. It starts at no cost with full functionality and fidelity. And there are no hidden tricks, no opportunities for sabotage of inconvenient competitors. Because many of the leading players in the ODF arena (such as IBM Lotus Symphony, LibreOffice, Calligra, KOffice, AbiWord, the various plugins for Microsoft Word) are open source applications, there is 'full disclosure' and a very efficient 'best of breed' model built around ODF. NLnet foundation sees ODF as a key technology for the future of our society, which is why we have installed the ODF fund that significantly invests in in the area of ODF. From tools for collaboration to contributing to standardisation, from education and raising awareness to developer libraries -- we will be doing our best to contribute where possible.

{"description":"Internet Hardening Fund The internet is probably the single largest man-made structure ever, and it plays an important role in modern daily life. But the internet was never properly architected for such a critical global role. Its original protocols and designs have major security shortcomings in their designs, which are actively being exploited at an increasing scale. Many benefits of the internet have materialised for its users despite of this- as witnessed by everyday usage of the internet by billions of people. But at the same time fundamental design issues come up again and again, showing the need for a structural solution if we want to continue and grow those benefits. As a technical community we need to revisit the security and privacy properties of the underpinning standards, and after that we need to make sure that those standards are actually deployed. The problem with bad security architecture at the scale of the internet is that it really cannot be contained or managed well: anyone that finds some backdoor can equally abuse it - leaving the door open to large scale crime, state level actors aiming at societal disruption, commercial abuse and even just plain accidents that cascade out of control. As the IETF has put it: \"the internet is under technical attack\". The Internet Hardening Fund is aimed at funding its defense - its security, reliability, scalability and real-time behaviour. We believe that the future of the internet can be rewritten - chapter by chapter, standard by standard. It is a safely re-engineered internet of tomorrow people want and deserve, rather the internet of today that cannot fulfil its promises. Together with you we are up for the challenge.

{"description":"DNS Security Fund DNSSEC is one of the key technologies for a safer internet -&nbsp;i quite literally actually, because it unlocks a mechanism for the internet user to (automatically) certify that he or she is being sent to the right computer or service on the internet. In addition, through DANE new security mechanisms can be bootstrapped effortlessly. The DNSSEC fund is available for projects that help explore the possibilities of DNSSEC by building real world solutions, and finding novel use cases for this exciting technology. Read more about our Call for proposals procedure. Apply for a DNSSEC grant via our Sponsor Request form. Contact NLnet staff at dnssec@nlnet.nl for more information. Background information Domain names are vital to the way we use the internet, as businesses, public institutions and private individuals. While the original system of resolving domain names was very robust and has made tremendous innovation possible, it was also found to be open to serious abuse. DNSSEC provides a cryptographic seal of authenticity that gives real proof of the validity of the domain name you use when you visit a website, chat or send an email. With DNSSEC you get what security specialists call a chain of trust from the root of the internet to the service you want to connect to -&nbsp;opening the way form many new exciting opportunities. DNSSEC is being gradually introduced worldwide, country by country. Of course it is already a big win that the chain can henceforth be trusted up to the point where providers relay the answer to the client. But this is not good enough for perfectly normal use such as using a (potentially hostile) public wifi hotspot: for end users to fully benefit from DNSSEC in such cases, the software on the end user side should be able to validate DNSSEC signatures as well -&nbsp;especially on sensitive data like digital security keys and certificates. Most (but not all) applications depend on higher level services to handle DNS, which means that these service stacks need to be updated in all operating systems. Specific client software using their own built-in DNS services, like realtime communication software (e.g. SIP, XMPP), messaging servers and browsers, also will need to be adapted. Every internet user deserves to be protected by DNSSEC in all situations, yet currently end user software is ready for DNSSEC. In order to speed up the process of introduction of DNSSEC, the Netherlands-based charity NLnet foundation announces that it will open a fund where open source projects can apply for grants to work on DNSSEC in their applications. Through a lightweight and fast procedure, projects can secure funding for reengineering software to reliably work with DNSSEC. Grants will be handed out on the basis of real-world impact, urgency and technical quality of the proposals. Proposals should adhere to the normal requirements for proposals at NLnet, and be no longer than 2 pages of text. Some technology partially or fully funded through NLnet and the DNSSEC fund OpenDKIM by The Trusted Domain Project, an open source implementation of the DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) sender authentication system.

{"description":"About NLnet foundation The history of NLnet goes back to 1982 when a group of Europeans led by former NLnet director and member of the Internet Hall of Fame Teus Hagen announced the European Unix Network (EUnet) which became the first public wide area network in Europe and the place where internet was introduced to Europe. NLnet also pioneered the worlds first dial-in and ISDN infrastructure with full country coverage. In 1997 all commercial activities were sold to UUnet (now Verizon) and since that time NLnet has focussed on supporting the open internet, and the privacy and security of internet users. NLnet's core business is to support independent organizations and people that contribute to an open information society. We provide microgrants, advice and access to an interesting global network we established over the years.

{"url":"/thema/Privacy.html","title":"Privacy","description":"Privacy Anomos Anomos introduces a layer of security and anonymity currently absent in peer to peer file sharing protocols. Through the study of cryptography and anonymous networks such as TOR, a system is being designed which allows any individual to safely distribute files to a large audience without fear of legal or social repercussions. This technology is an important part of modern free society, and a tool which may be used around the world to bring about positive social change. With Anomos, one can distribute the file anonymously to thousands of people at once. Because Anomos is based on BitTorrent, each download makes the network faster, more robust, and harder to eliminate. This technology can benefit thousands of people all around the world, to those who live in religiously oppressive places, those to whom the mere accusation of apostasy or sexual deviance could be life threatening; to mash-up artists concerned about copyright infringement, or anyone fearful that their actions on the Internet may lead to unjust punishment. First and foremost, Anomos has been designed as a tool for free speech. Cryptech.is Cryptech.is is a project that want to design an open-source hardware cryptographic engine that can be built by anyone from public hardware specifications and open-source firmware. Anyone can then operate it without fees of any kind. DIFR-TSPM -- DIFR Tag-Scan-Privacy-Match Increasingly, products for sale in shops are being tagged by RFID tags. These tags contain a unique product or item number, which can be read out wirelessly over a short distance by an RFID reader. Their function in shops and supermarkets is similar to the ubiquitous paper barcode, except that RFID tags can also be read out if the tag is not in plain sight of the reader. This means these tags can also be read out surreptitiously when walking around the store, or afterwards when the items are in your shopping bag and you are walking on the street. This also holds true for payment cards and travel passes (e.g. the OV chipcard in the Netherlands) that people carry with them. This has raised concerns about the impact for RFID technology on the privacy in our society. The goal of the project is to develop a demonstrator of a different way to inform consumers about the RFID tags on the items they buy or the tags that surround them in their environment. Main idea is to use a mobile phone to display information about RFID tags in the vicinity. In particular, the setup of the demonstrator will operate as follows. A consumer sets his privacy preferences in a profile stored on his mobile phone. If he holds the phone close to a product in a shop containing an RFID tag, the phone will read the tag number from the tag. It will then query (over the Internet, either through GPRS, UMTS or WiFi) the backoffice to retrieve the privacy policy corresponding to the tag number. Then it will match the tag policy with the consumer policy, and present the result of the match to the consumer on the display of the mobile phone in an intuitive and appealing manner. This demonstrator will be used to show how such a concept: empowers users in deciding for themselves how their privacy is affected and how to respond to that information, and allows producers to efficiently communicate their privacy policy to consumers. DNSSEC-mail Until recent developments of domain name authentication, Internet mail has not had access to scalable mechanisms for validating an identity associated with a message. Any identifier could be used fraudulently. The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) are relatively new technologies that create a foundational change by validating domain identifiers. However they are only the first step. DMARC takes additional steps in allowing domain owners to publish statements about their email use of their identifiers and DMARC facilitates much easier operational reporting from mail recipients to domain owners.

{"url":"/thema/OpenData.html","description":"OpenData LTSP Deskop -- Desktops op LTSP Cluster Thin clients (PCs where all data is kept on a remote server and only the desktop is kept locally), are already in use for a long time. These days, increased bandwidth and Cloud Computing allow us to go further, even to stream the complete desktop from the Internet. The possibility to start a desktop \"on demand\" from the cloud offers interesting new collaboration possibilities: any application can instantly become remote accessible. For instance, having a graphic design reviewed by a design interface specialist. Or program together/review code within a single IDE instance. The goal of this project is to completely integrate remote access to a cluster of LTSP servers that can be directly accessible or streamed from any private or public cloud (like Amazon EC2 or Eucalyptus). At start, the project is targeted at Open Source specialists which should test the new functionality, translations and design. Development versions are simple to test: no need to \"scrap\" my computer: simply instantiate a remote development desktop. Schools are a second target. Schools will be able to distribute any application to any computer with the LTSP-Cluster. Schools all over the World will be able to provide the complete school environment to any child (using Windows, Linux or Mac computer). All students have access to the same educational tools. OpenStreetMapNL -- OpenStreetMap Netherlands ( ) Het geodatalandschap verandert. Overheidsdata wordt meer en meer vrij beschikbaar. Belangrijke kaartenleveranciers TeleAtlas en Navteq verliezen hun onafhankelijke positie door inlijving bij TomTom respectievelijk Nokia. Tegelijkertijd neemt het belang van het `Geografische Web' steeds toe en nemen gebruikers van geografische informatie geen genoegen meer met een passieve gebruikersrol. De commerciële leveranciers herijken hun strategie teneinde een graantje te kunnen meepikken van `user generated content'. In dit veranderende landschap wordt OpenStreetMap steeds meer een factor om mee te rekenen --in het bijzonder in Nederland. Als onafhankelijke bron van een hoogwaardige, landsdekkende, volledige en bovendien vrij te gebruiken geodataset van Nederland eist OpenStreetMap een duidelijke plaats op. Dat zal niet ongemerkt blijven. Er zullen meer eindgebruikers komen. Er zullen meer bedrijven geïnteresseerd raken in het inzetten van OpenStreetMap-data in hun systemen, websites en applicaties. Nieuwe toepassingen zullen het levenslicht zien. Wellicht volgen er nog meer donaties van geografische data. Dit project is specifiek gericht op: Ontwikkelen van systemen voor backups, rollback-mogelijkheden, signaleren van wijzigingen en toekenning van niveaus van vertrouwen gekoppeld aan bijdragers en hun wijzigingen. Ontwikkelen van een lichtgewicht mobiele editor om het rechtstreeks controleren en aanpassen van de OpenStreetMap-data `in het veld’ mogelijk te maken. Ontwikkelen van een laagdrempeliger interface voor het doorgeven van eenvoudige wijzigingen door ‘leken’. Searsia Searsia provides the means to create a personal, private, and configurable search engine, that combines search results freely from a very large number of sources. Searsia enables existing sources to cooperate such that they together provide a search service that resembles today’s large search engines. In addition to using external services at will, you can also use it to integrate whatever private information from within your organisation - so your users or community can use a single search engine to serve their needs.","title":"OpenData"},

The two main programs are aap (a replacement for make ) and agide (the A-A-P GUI IDE). The agide program provides a portable framework to combine existing programs. Agide provides interfaces between editors, viewers, debuggers, cross referencers, etc. These are used connect any editor to any debugger, without the need to implement every combination. Agide relates to many existing tools and adds the glue to make them work together. A central element is the A-A-P recipe. It is a powerful replacement for Makefiles and shell scripts. The Aap program is used to execute the recipes. It can be used for building software, version control, maintaining a web site, installing ported software, and much more. BlenderWeb -- Blender Web Plugin There is currently no open source platform capable of delivering rich web content similar in scope and impact to Adobe Flash and Shockwave or Microsoft Silverlight. Creators and developers are tied to proprietary tools and software if they wish to create rich interactive content for online distribution and consumption. This creates a high barrier to entry in many countries the cost of Adobe software licenses can be more than a years salary for an artist --so only those individuals of wealth can make use of this communications medium. This project is devoted to the development of the web plugin of the game engine, improve its security and resource utilization and add functionality, in general produce an end-to-end solution and open source platform capable of delivering 2d and 3d content of a richness and variety similar to that available in the propriety Adobe Flash and Adobe Shockwave plugins. CP2PC -- Copy To PC CP2PC (pronounced \"copy to pc\") develops a minimal programming interface to peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems. Client side applications can be built on top of this interface by other projects. In addition, the project includes development of a simple GUI client that integrates various file-sharing systems. CUGAR -- Closed User Group Access Router This project aims to develop and implement a (Wireless) Access Point and a back-end for it using only Open Source software components. The Access Point (AP) together with the back-end makes secure environment for Closed User Group Services. This allows a secure connection between AP and the back-end when using a non-secure transport medium (like the Internet). The whole system is being developed as an \"appliance\" and a back-end software package. AP itself will be implemented on small embedded systems in order to ease the deployment. The back-end (authentication, management, routing) can run on a generic UNIX system. Dowse Dowse is a smart digital network appliance for home based local area networks (LAN), but also small and medium business offices, that makes it possible to connect objects and people in a friendly, conscious and responsible manner. FileSender -- FileSender FileSender is a self-hosted service that allows you to share very large files with anyone. FreeBSD-3G -- 3G support for FreeBSD The project started by improving 3GPP support for Option GT GPRS/EDGE cards, to provide a second serial channel to retrieve signal quality and other status info from the data card while being online. Starting off with the OpenMoko 3GPP implementation, this was quickly replaced with own development due to memory constraints on embedded systems. Later, similar functionality was added for data cards which use an internal USB-hub with several serial ports connected. The project contains: development of a FreeBSD driver for data cards supported by the Linux hso driver; development of FreeBSD driver for nozomi type Option cards; improvements to, and open sourcing of, the 3GPP protocol daemon; and setup of Knowledge Base website. Each of these individual subprojects is valuable on its own."},

The internet brought so many advantages that it grew explosively, but that unprecedented growth of an experimental infrastructure that had many (and sometimes intentional) fundamental weaknesses - in terms of e.g. scalability and more importantly of security - resulted in an ossified network that has a lot of technical debt accumulated. It takes a concerted effort to fix these holes and bring secure internet technologies towards real end-users and deep into the infrastructure where many important upgrades are waiting for adoption. Atom-Based Routing -- Improving global internet routing Atom-Based Routing aims at significantly reducing the growth of BGP table size and updates, in particular in the internet backbone, through the use of BGP policy atoms. The intent is to devise a routing protocol (or adapt a routing protocol such as BGP) which makes use of atoms to achieve a protocol of lower complexity. BIND DLZ -- BIND Dynamically Loadable Zones BIND DLZ allows DNS data to be modified without interrupting the DNS server's normal operation. It accomplishes this by moving DNS data out of BIND 's in memory database into an external database. BIND DLZ works with a large variety of databases and has made flexibility a priority in its design. Additionally, BIND DLZ makes available an API which can be used to create custom drivers to access nearly any database, or provide other functionality such as DNS load balancing. Bricophone -- The Bricophone Project The Bricophone is a community-oriented mobile phone infrastructure in Open Source. It is a low cost, low energy, open hardware, open source project built for communities up to ten thousand people within regional distances. The characteristic of the Bricophone infrastructure is that it does not require any static infrastructure like relays, antennas, or digital data centers. This provides the opportunity for special uses in poor communities, mass rescueing in disastered areas, and cultural and social activities like festivals and other mass events. CeroWRT -- Cake implementation in CeroWRT This project aims to be a reference implementation of the Comprehensive Queue Management Made Easy (CAKE) project based on CeroWrt, the experimental firmware aiming to push forward the state of the art of edge networks and routers. Cryptech.is Cryptech.is is a project that want to design an open-source hardware cryptographic engine that can be built by anyone from public hardware specifications and open-source firmware. Anyone can then operate it without fees of any kind. CuteHIP The project of the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology ( HIIT ) will create a lightweight implementation of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) on Java. Existing HIP implementations have been evolving since 2004 and became complex and hard to maintain and use. There is a need for new simple implementation of RFC5201-5202 that is cross-platform (not bound to any Operating System) and not limited to run on any vendor hardware. The project will make CuteHIP implementation using Java. It will be based on SourceForge open repository for public access and contributions. Although there are more open-source HIP implementations (HIPL, OpenHIP, Hip4inter.net), those are limited to certain platforms like Linux; no implementation is written on Java yet. The CuteHIP implementation shall be interoperable with existing implementations but shall be new and hence free of accumulated bugs.

The fund aims to give a direct impulse to the technical and operational basis of a safer and more secure internet, and to contribute to improving the availability of high-end encryption mechanisms. The fund is operated by NLnet Foundation, the public benefit organisation set up by the Dutch pioneers that helped introduce the internet in Europe in the eighties. The main focus of the new Internet Hardening Fund is twofold: on the one hand supporting high end open source encryption software used in the infrastructural layer, and on the other hand development and strengthening of the underlying internet and web standards in the area of encryption. The fund operates internationally. A new competitive call for proposals is launched every two months. Projects or individuals that request a grant will also automatically enter the competitive open call from NLnet, which additionally increases their chance of funding. Through the fund independent researchers and developers can requests grants in support of their efforts to improve and expand encryption and other means of securing internet communication. Hardening the internet means we are making it more robust against all kinds of abuse, says Marc Gauw, general director of NLnet foundation, Cryptography carries the huge responsibility of protecting internet traffic from being tampered with, and there is a lot of catching up to do. The health of the internet is determined to a large extent by its weakest parts. As we've seen demonstrated with the recent large scale attacks, there can be no safe zone on the internet as long as there are weaknesses that can be exploited at a very large scale. With the Internet Hardening Fund we can use the collective power of the technical community and the instrument of open source to help raise the level of security for everyone. The Netherlands government has recently been increasing its support for open standards and open source, and has maintained a strong and well-informed position on encryption. In december 2015, the Netherlands House of Representatives made a clear statement in support of that position when it unanimously accepted a motion by D66 MP Kees Verhoeven. This motion urged the cabinet to support the open source communities that are responsible for maintaining critical parts of the internet infrastructure, stating that encryption is a necessary prerequisite for the freedom and safety of people, and important to protect the right to freedom of expression and to protect trade secrets. I think we all agree that a strong, secure and open internet is vital for both society and the global economy says Marc Gauw, The Internet Hardening Fund is set up to harness the talent of developers and technical community to continue to come up with solutions in a transparent, cost-effective and bottom-up way. We hope many other stakeholders - private and public alike - will see the huge benefits of this approach and will follow the lead of the Netherlands government.

Bovendien draagt de Nederlandse digitale infrastructuur significant bij aan onze internet-\u001feconomie die op zijn beurt weer zorgt voor groei in werkgelegenheid. Dat blijkt uit een onderzoek dat is uitgevoerd door Deloitte, in opdracht van AMS-IX, DHPA, ECP, SIDN, NBIP, Nederland ICT, NLnet en Rabobank. Het onderzoek richt zich specifiek op de internet exchange, datacenter housing en hosting sector die – samen met telecommunicatie – de digitale infrastructuur vormen. Uit het onderzoek van Deloitte naar deze sector in 2013 bleek al dat Nederland beschikt over een sterke digitale infrastructuur, die in het licht van de snelle groei van het wereldwijde internet moet worden beschouwd als Nederlands derde mainport. Koploper Het belang van onze digitale infrastructuur wordt steeds groter. De Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) blijft 's werelds grootste internet exchange. Alleen al in de laatste twaalf maanden groeide het internetverkeer van deze internet exchange met maar liefst dertig procent. De regio Amsterdam behoudt ook zijn positie als één van Europa’s belangrijkste hotspots voor co-locatie (datacenters) met een jaarlijkse groei van ruim zes procent. In Europa behaalt Nederland tevens een sterke tweede plaats als het gaat om hosting-diensten. Impact op de Nederlandse economie De housing en hosting sector binnen de Nederlandse digitale infrastructuur is een kapitaalintensieve sector met een jaarlijkse omzet van € 1,18 miljard en investeringen van € 380 miljoen. Er werken in deze sector ongeveer 7.600 mensen. Circa 11.700 banen komen voort uit de sectoren die direct betrokken zijn, zoals bouw en toeleveranciers, en uit bestedingen van werknemers. De werkgelegenheid groeit met ca. acht procent per jaar. Digitale infrastructuur als fundament voor digitale economie De omvang van de werkgelegenheid in de digitale-infrastructuursector zelf is niet torenhoog, maar werkt wel sterk door in de veel bredere digitale economie en samenleving. De digitale infrastructuur is een onderdeel van het hele ecosysteem en daarmee één van de ‘drivers’ voor de internet-economie. De Nederlandse internet-economie wordt geschat op 5,3 procent van het BBP en groeit jaarlijks met negen procent. Het onderzoek wijst uit dat de aanwezigheid van een sterke digitale infrastructuur een belangrijke aanjager is voor de werkgelegenheid in e-commerce en cloud-diensten. In theorie zou een vrije internet-economie zich ook los van de lokale datacenters en hosting kunnen ontwikkelen, omdat internetdiensten ook in andere landen kunnen worden gehost, zegt Michiel Steltman, directeur van de DHPA. Maar ons onderzoek toont juist aan dat er een sterke correlatie is tussen de groei van de lokale internet-economie en de aanwezigheid van een sterke nationale digitale-infrastructuursector. Steltman legt uit dat dit te maken heeft met een 3-tal effecten die elkaar onderling versterken: de online sector en de digitale-infrastructuursector profiteren beide van dezelfde onderliggende groeifactoren Vraag-effect: groei in de internet-economie veroorzaakt een groei in de vraag naar digitale infrastructuur Aanbod-effect: de aanwezigheid van een sterke digitale infrastructuur trekt vervolgens weer aanbieders aan van online producten en diensten naar Nederland Het onderzoek wijst daarmee uit dat een sterke digitale infrastructuur bijdraagt aan groei van de digitale economie als geheel.

The Netherlands' digital infrastructure contributes significantly to our internet economy which in turn provides growth in employment. Those are the results of research done by Deloitte, commissioned by AMS-IX, DHPA, ECP, SIDN, NBIP, Nederland ICT, NLnet and Rabobank. The research is aimed specifically at the internet exchange, datacenter housing and hosting sector who &emdash; together with the telecommunication sector &emdash; comprise the digital infrastructure. Earlier research of Deloitte around this sector in 2013 already showed that the Netherlands has a strong digital infrastructure, which given the fast growth of the world wide internet should be considered as the third mainport of the country. Frontrunner The importance of our digital infrastructure continues to grow. The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) remains the worlds largest internet exchange. In the last twelve months alone the internet traffic in this internet exchange grew by thirty percent. The Amsterdam region also holds on to its place as one of Europes prime hotspots for co-location (datacenters) with an annual growth of over six percent. In Europe the Netherlands also holds a strong second place where hosting services are concerned. Impact on the Netherlands economy The housing and hosting sector within the Netherlands' digital infrastructure is a capital intensive sector with an annual turnover over € 1,18 billion and investments of € 380 million. In this sector around 7.600 people work. Around 11.700 jobs are produced by sectors which are immediately involved, such as construction and suppliers, and from spending of employees. Employment grew with around eight percent per year. Digital infrastructure as a fundament for digital economy The number of jobs in the digital infrastructure sector itself may not be high in the absolute sense, but the sector has a strong influence in the much broader digital economy and society. The digital infrastructure is part of the whole ecosystem and one of the drivers for the internet economy. The Netherlands' internet economy is estimated at 5,3 percent of the GDP and annually grows with nine percent. The research indicated that the presence of a strong digital infrastructure is an important stimulus for the employment in e-commerce and cloud services. In theory an internet economy could develop also independent from the local datacenters and hosting, as internet services could be hosted in other countries, says Michiel Steltman, director of DHPA. However our research shows that there is a strong correlation between the growth of the local internet economy and the presence of a strong national digital infrastructure sector. Steltman explains that this has to do with three mutually reinforcing effects: the online sector and the digital infrastructure sector both profit from the same underlying growth factors Demand effect: growth in the internet economy causes a growth in the demand for digital infrastructure Supply effect: the presence of a strong digital infrastructure pulls in suppliers from online products and services to the Netherlands The research indicates that a strong digital infrastructure contributes to growth of the digital economy as a whole. Countries with a strong digital infrastructure sector gain more economically from the resulting innovations and productivity growth. Recommendations for the optimal use of the strong position in digital infrastructure The researchers have formulated six recommendations to maintain the strong position of the Netherlands, make appropriate use of it and stimulate further economical growth: Support investments and developments in"},

The 'Trusted Networks Initiative' makes it possible to close off part of the internet temporarily to wield off the attack, while important websites remain accessible to regular end users. The initiative will be launched on 28 october 2014 during ' Holland Strikes Back ', where a number of thought leaders from the industry present key Dutch innovations against cybercrime. The idea for the 'Trusted Networks Initiative' was developed by NLnet foundation and internet exchange NL-ix, together with the national security cluster The Hague Security Delta, with the aim to reduce the economical damage of these cyber attacks and the amount of disturbance for end users. The product that we've developed with partners from the financial sector and internet operators, is also an innovation that can be productized internationally, helping to put the Netherlands on the map in the area of cyber security, says Rob de Wijk, general director of The Hague Security Delta. Trusted Networks Initiative The 'Trusted Networks Initiative' classifies websites and networks as 'trusted' and helps them to differentiate between 'reliable' and 'less reliable' internet, which allows to close off the less reliable part of the internet in case of an extremely severe DDoS attack. This project provides an alternative for an 'National Emergency Network', which has been discussed by some but which has not yet led to any results. It is not in violation of the principle of net neutrality because every website can decide on any given moment if a DDoS attack is so harsh that the incoming traffic needs to be limited to a subset of the internet. \"The simplicity of the idea just shines\" Cyber threats by now have become a significant risk to society. Recently The World Economic Forum (WEF) warned against a possible 'cybergeddon' in her annual risk audit, states Rob De Wijk, general director of The Hague Security Delta (HSD). We are therefore proud that as HSD we are one of the founders of such a promising solution to reduce the risks.. The simplicity of the idea just shines: already in mediaval times the draw bridge was pulled up when the enemy was in front of the gates, remarks Marc Gauw, general director of NLnet foundation. The only challenge is in creating the awareness that this kind of solution has to be put in place before an incident takes place, and not after. As one of the founding partners NL-ix is excited to be the first to offer 'Trusted Routing' through our internet exchange, states Jan Hoogenboom, CEO of NL-ix. In this first fase interested, critical websites can be classified as 'Trusted Network', building up experience with the concept, to subsequently extend the solution to more parties and also internationally.

Op deze dag brengen zij middels toonaangevende sprekers de belangrijkste Nederlandse initiatieven tegen cyberaanvallen samen. Nederland is een internationale speler op het gebied van internetinfrastructuur en is daarmee ook een aantrekkelijk doelwit voor cyberaanvallen. Gelukkig is Nederland ook zeer actief op het gebied van IT-innovatie en weten de online sector, het bedrijfsleven en de overheid zich steeds beter te weren tegen cybermisdaad. Op 28 oktober a.s. presenteren toonaangevende sprekers de belangrijkste Nederlandse initiatieven tegen cyberaanvallen. Onder meer Dick Schoof (NCTV), Gert Wabeke (KPN), Dr. Michel van Eeten (TU Delft), Barend Sluijter (NCSC), en Jan Piet Barthel (NWO) betreden op deze dag het podium. Zij gaan in op het omgaan met DDoS-aanvallen, de NaWas, AbuseHub, Secure Peering, ethisch hacken, Secure DNS en samenwerkingen in Europees verband. Nederland herbergt heel veel internationaal toonaangevende initiatieven op het gebied van internetveiligheid en robuustheid, vaak met belang voor de hele sector, stelt Marc Gauw, algemeen directeur van stichting NLnet, maar de kennis erover blijft vaak steken bij een beperkt aantal organisaties. Het werd hoog tijd om alles een keer bij elkaar te brengen. Simon Besteman, Directeur ISPConnect: We zullen aandacht schenken aan het toenemende internetmisbruik en wat de gevolgen daarvan zijn voor onder andere het bedrijfsleven. Daarna gaan wij in op lopende en toekomstige initiatieven die cybercrime tegen moeten gaan. Met een sterk inhoudelijk programma, mede mogelijk gemaakt door Infradata, ASP4all, de HSD, NL-ix, Surfnet, SIDN, Verisign en Ziggo, alsmede voldoende netwerkmogelijkheden verwacht de organisatie ruim 200 bezoekers naar de De Rijtuigenloods te Amersfoort te trekken. De samenwerking tussen verschillende partijen binnen de online sector en de overheid is een goed teken. Cybercrime staat hoog op de agenda en gelukkig kunnen wij met dit initiatief een gedegen platform bieden en IT-kennis met elkaar delen. Aldus Michiel Steltman, Directeur van de DHPA.

Over NLnet Stichting NLnet legde in de jaren tachtig de basis voor het Nederlandse internet. De geschiedenis van NLnet gaat terug tot 1982 toen een groep Europeanen onder leiding van de latere NLnet-voorzitter Teus Hagen het Europese unix-netwerk EUnet aankondigde. Dat leidde tot het eerste publieke grootschalige computernetwerk in Europa, waarmee de basis werd gelegd voor de komst van het internet in Europa. De statutaire doelstelling van Stichting NLnet is \"het bevorderen van elektronische informatie-uitwisseling en al hetgeen daarmee verband houdt of daartoe bevorderlijk kan zijn\". NLnet werkt aan een duurzaam en open internet, waartoe jaarlijks een aantal strategische projecten en organisaties ondersteund worden"},

NLnet is the original not-for-profit responsible for introducing the internet in the Netherlands in the eighties. The money will be used to fund a new expansion of the Nationale Wasstraat. NaWas is a initiative of ISP organisation NBIP aimed at hosting providers, midsize ISPs and users, providing a collective solution against so called DDoS attacks. NaWas is used to filter out large amounts of fake internet traffic as used by attackers to bring down internet services. By pooling resources NaWas has vastly more bandwidth and more advanced anti-DDoS equipment from different vendors than could be afforded by each participating internet provider or user. The capacity for handling attacks is shared by the participating organisations. The system went live since March 2014, and already needs to be expanded because of the large interest in the market place. NaWas is clearly meeting a huge need, states Alex Bik, chairman of NBIP, Not only do we see a large demand for connecting to NaWas, but NBIP also gets many invitations to speak at conferences on how it helps protect our national digital infrastructure. Marc Gauw, general director of NLnet, is also very pleased with the success of the initiative: It helps more organisations to adequately shield themselves against DDOS attacks, while the internet traffic itself doesn't leave the country so the data of the users is not unnecessarily exposed to prying eyes of foreign actors. NBIP &mdash; as a not-for-profit &mdash; is offering the NaWas service at cost price for both internet providers as regular users. This makes it a very welcome alternative for buying ones own anti-DDoS equipment, or using a commercial anti-DDoS service. More information about NaWas","title":"Press release"},

Een aantal prominente vertegenwoordigers van het Nederlandse internet neemt vandaag het initiatief om internetgebruikers als belanghebbenden vertegenwoordigd te laten zijn in de rechtzaak van Brein tegen Ziggo en XS4all en in andere rechtszaken die (gaan) spelen rondom het blokkeren van internetverkeer. Per 1 februari 2012 worden beide interproviders - in weerwil van een hoger beroep - via een dwangsom gedwongen om technisch onverstandige en zeer invasieve maatregelen te nemen. Dat betekent een minder stabiel en langzamer internet voor miljoenen klanten - zowel burgers, bedrijven als ook een groot gedeelte van alle Nederlandse scholen. \"De impact van de maatregelen zoals die zijn opgelegd is onevenredig schadelijk\", zo stelt Marleen Stikker, directeur van Waag Society en in de vroege jaren '90 initiatiefnemer van De Digitale Stad. \"Internet neemt een centrale rol in in onze samenleving, en dit is vragen om problemen. We kunnen de verantwoordelijkheid voor het wegnemen van deze dreiging niet alleen bij juristen van twee ondernemingen leggen.\" De initiatiefnemers willen met SOS Internet middelen bij elkaar brengen om zich als partij te kunnen voegen bij lopende rechtszaken die de openheid en stabiliteit van het internet raken. Geld dat bijeen gebracht wordt door internetgebruikers zal worden gebruikt voor het daarbij inschakelen van gekwalificeerde technische en juridische deskundigen op het vlak van internettechnologie, en het uitzetten van gekwalificeerd wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de effecten van voorgestelde ingrepen in rechtszaken of wetgeving. \"Het is een ding als dergelijk verstrekkende ingrepen in netwerken gerealiseerd worden na democratisch tot stand gekomen wetgeving en op basis van voldoende inzicht in de technologie,\", stelt internetexpert Hendrik Rood. \"Het is wat anders als dat gebeurt na een interpretatieve oprekking van juridische begrippen ten faveure van de belangen van 'e'en belangengroep.\" Naast het hoger beroep van de twee internetproviders liggen er nog meer rechtszaken in het verschiet - ook andere providers zijn inmiddels benaderd met verzoeken tot blokkades. \"Dit soort materie kan niet alleen bekeken worden met een kokervisie richting het enge domein van Auteursrecht\", aldus Simon Hania, een van de mede-initiatiefnemers en voormalig technisch directeur van XS4all. \"We willen de doelpalen verplaatsen naar de implicaties voor de samenleving.\" Het initiatief draagt de naam SOS Internet, wat staat voor Steunfonds Open en Stabiel Internet. Het fonds wordt kostenloos professioneel beheerd door NLnet Foundation, dertig jaar geleden de grondleggers van internet in Nederland en nu een van de belangrijkste liefdadigheidsfondsen op internetgebied wereldwijd. Donateurs kunnen er dus zeker van zijn dat het geld allemaal terecht komt waarvoor het bedoeld is - een open internet. De officiele lancering zal over drie weken plaatsvinden op een brainstormbijeenkomst in het Anatomisch Theater van Waag Society (op 23 februari 2012).

Stichting NLnet maakt vandaag bekend dat het het Unhosted project zal ondersteunen met een werkbeurs van een jaar. Unhosted is een baanbrekend project dat een veiliger alternatief wil bieden aan gebruikers om te werken met webapplicaties, doordat het een scheiding maakt tussen software die draait op het internet en hun (persoonlijke en zakelijke) gegevens. Unhosted maakt het mogelijk om software te gebruiken die draait en beheerd wordt bij een leverancier terwijl de gegevens elders blijven - ook binnen in het prive-domein van een persoon of organisatie. Omdat de applicatie en de gegevens elkaar kunnen ontmoeten in de browser, is er geen reden is om dataopslag te beperken tot de plek waar de software vandaan komt. \"Wij denken dat Unhosted een nieuw paradigma biedt voor internetapplicaties,\", zegt Michiel Leenaars, directeur strategie bij Stichting NLnet, \"Net als reguliere software niet oplegt aan je waar je data staat, kan software die je verbruikt als dienst het net zo goed mogelijk maken om gegevens te laten waar de gebruiker maar wil. Het ligt in feite erg voor de hand.\" \"Computers hebben een harde schijf erin met al je gegevens binnen je eigen beheer. Maar meer en meer applicaties worden online gedraait, wat ons ertoe dwingt om onze data op andermans servers te zetten. Behalve dat onze gegevens worden opgesloten op een plek waar we er zelf geen controle over hebben, verkopen veel websites onze gegevens aan derden. Dit is een regelrechte crisis in termen van de rechten van de consument, zegt Unhosted-projectleider Michiel de Jong. \"Aangezien software verhuist naar de cloud, wordt de pc vervangen door glimmende apparaten zoals de iPad en Chromebook. De iPad synchroniseert met de Apple-cloud, en de Chromebook synchroniseert met de Google cloud. Maar unhosted web apps laten de gebruiker beslissen aan welke cloudaanbieder zij de voorkeur geven. Consumenten kunnen nu al tussen meerdere aanbieders van nutsvoorzieningen kiezen zoals elektriciteit, telefonie en internetverbinding. Onze protocol doet hetzelfde voor je externe opslag.\" Unhosted werd vandag precies een jaar geleden gestart, op 9 september 2010, door een groep vrijwilligers onder leiding van Michiel de Jong, een Nederlandse softwareontwikkelaar die gevestigd in Berlijn. Het project biedt zowel een implementatie-agnostisch protocol - op basis van bestaande standaarden zoals WebDAV, OAuth en Webfinger - en een softwareontwikkelpakket (SDK) dat kan worden gebruikt voor eenvoudige integratie binnen toepassingen. In aanvulling op de subsidie van stichting NLnet, heeft Unhosted tot nu toe al 14.000 euro geworven via crowdsourced financiering. Acceptatie van cloud-applicaties hangt veelal af van het vertrouwen dat mensen hebben in hun leveranciers, en Unhosted vergroot de mogelijkheden voor mensen om externe toepassingen te gebruiken zonder bang te hoeven hun gegevens worden gebruikt voor ongewenste doeleinden. \"Unhosted neemt het gangbare idee van de cloud een stap verder door het scheiden van functionaliteit, vertrouwen en opslag naar verschillende plaatsen in de cloud\", zegt Leenaars. \"Het wijst ons op de uitdagende gedachte dat de beste technologie-aanbieder het daar misschien ook wel bij moet houden, en dat zij niet de beheerder hoeft te zijn van onze particuliere en commerci&euml;le geheimen.\" Om aan de materie verder te werken in een open en leverancierneutrale context werd deze week een unhosted 'community group' gelanceerd binnen het World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

The cards will use modern cryptographic techniques that will allow passengers to buy a personalised card --with tailored discounts-- without the need or risk of having all ones travels unravelled. Radboud University in Nijmegen has received a targeted research grant from the Dutch philanthropic foundation NLnet. Earlier this year a major smartcard system with similar goals in the Netherlands was easily compromised by investigators, and earlier this week these were able to repeat their findings with the Oyster card scheme used in the UK. \"With the failure of that first generation of smart cards for public transport in the Netherlands and elsewhere a huge disinvestment is looming,\" states Michiel Leenaars, strategy director at NLnet foundation. \"That cost or even the delay is just not acceptable for societies that depends heavily on this critical infrastructure\". Although this is in principle a commercial area with significant revenue streams, the new initiative is funded by private charity money in an effort to ensure that not only abuse is countered but also that there are technical guarantees for maintaining the privacy of passengers. \"By putting the development in an open context and embed privacy in the design phase --and not as an afterthought-- we hope to lay the foundations for a next-generation smart card for public transport in the Netherlands and beyond that works and really is worth the full confidence of consumers\", says Leenaars. The public failure of the previous initiative that took place in a closed environment meant that the work needed to be redone in another way --and it proved the point in case that the privacy side needed more attention as well. The research at Radboud University Nijmegen will be carried out within the Digital Security Group, headed by Prof. dr. Bart Jacobs and Dr. Wouter Teepe. This academic group has made regular headlines across the world in recent years when they revealed weaknesses in smart cards that are at present widely used, allowing free travel and denial of service attacks. In their research and experimental work the researchers aim to see whether the proposed privacy techniques are actually suitable for an efficient, robust and secure implementation of smart cards --usable also in other classes of systems such as mobile phones or pocket computers. All developed software for the public transport smartcard v2.0 will be \"open source\" and by principle will be accessible to everyone. This will allow individuals, for example, to verify whether travel and personal information are indeed adequately protected. Open source software is not only increasingly becoming a development method of choice, not only in government and the academic world but also elsewhere, having many advantages over proprietary software (whose operation is secret).","title":"OV-chip 2.0"},

Daar willen we samen met de gebruikers en professionals zelf wat aan doen.\" NLnet hanteert het uitgangspunt dat veiligheid en privacy te belangrijk zijn om enkel aan commerciele partijen toe te vertrouwen. \"We willen op een speelse manier kennis over tools verzamelen die de gewone internetgebruiker kan gebruiken om zichzelf te beschermen,\" stelt Leenaars. De nadruk daarbij ligt naast veiligheid ook op usability, omdat uit ervaring gebleken is dat beveiliging die in de weg van de gebruiker zit al snel wordt uitgeschakeld.

User himself to drive non-commercial security effort. Amsterdam, May 15, 2008 [ Contest webpage ] [ Dit persbericht in het Nederlands ] The Netherlands-based not-for-profit organization NLnet is launching a international competition in which participants must bring together tools to protect ordinary end users against cybercrime and privacy leaks. The launch of the contest will take place on Thursday, May 15 during a security conference in Ede, The Netherlands. NLnet manages a large private fund of some tens of millions, from which the foundation annually invests significantly in social initiatives in the area of open standards, open source, privacy and digital civil rights across the globe. The contest is part of a longer running program to increase privacy and security in the ICT field. \"Normal computer users on the information superhighway all too easily fall prey to external abuse,\" says Michiel Leenaars, Strategy director of the foundation. \"The same opportunities that have transformed the Web into a form of social software have at the same time created enormous vulnerabilities. We want to do something about that, in cooperation with the users and professionals themselves\". NLnet works from the premise that security and privacy are too important to merely outsource to individual commercial parties. \"We want to gather in a playful way knowledge about the best tools that ordinary Internet users can use to protect themselves,\" says Leenaars. That means next to security concerns a second emphasis is on usability, because experience has shown that security that gets in the way of user is quickly turned off or circumvented. The foundation is also looking for ideas how to make available professional tools usable for novice users without many technical skills. The main prize is 2,500 euros, there are some other worthwile prices. The foundation intends to process the results from the competition and bring the best tools together to distribute through various channels. Deadline for submission is August 15, 2008 at 12:00 CET. The results are to be announced before September 15, 2008. All entries are welcome: usersafety2008@nlnet.nl. Participation is open to all nationalities.

{"url":"/press/20080118-formats.html","description":"NLnet Press-release NLnet again calls Microsoft for more openness \"Non-disclosure will hurt standardisation OOXML\" American software vendor Microsoft announced this week --under pressure from the market-- that the company will be publishing some of its documentation on the specifications of its older, binary file formats next month. It persists in not providing a direct mapping of its new OOXML format to those same formats. NLnet Foundation, a societal investor and member of the ECMA TC45 that is led by Microsoft, is much dissatisfied with Microsoft's lack of cooperation in both areas. \"It is too little, too late. This is old stuff that is vastly incomplete and totally illegible. Anybody wanting to read his own documents in another application is dependant on lots of reverse engineering by someone, as these documents are just the tip of the iceberg,\" states Michiel Leenaars, strategy manager at NLnet and member of the Netherlands mirror committee for ISO/JTC1 SC34. The Foundation points to the similarities with the SMB-case where after five years of lawsuits Microsoft was forced by the European Commission to release 15,000 pages of information to its competitors --about a technically much simpler specification than OOXML. NLnet thinks that this time the market will not wait, because Microsoft has a much weaker position that its uncooperative behaviour now assumes. \"The lack of respect of Microsoft for the interests of its customers is actually hurting Microsoft itself the most. You would think they would want to shun any more controversy around OOXML if it is to become an ISO archiving standard.\" The foundation thinks that the national standards bodies --that explicitly requested the different binary file formats to be released in time for them to take along with their analysis of the dispositions-- are in for a suprise and that the documentation will only confuse people. \"Why publication had to wait until after the dispositions were published, is unclear. The direct demand from the national bodies has been known by Microsoft at least five months ago,\" says Leenaars. This leaves national bodies one week after publication by Microsoft to read yet another stack of documents on top of the many thousands of pages of dispositions that were released last monday by ECMA that also need to be reviewed comment by comment. \"Surely no-one in the world of standards wants to rubberstamp an untested proposal that is built on ghost file formats of the past not still available to them,\" says Leenaars. \"OOXML was meant to be compatible with something very specific, but does not contain a single reference to any of the documentation that Microsoft will be publishing --not one reference. How can you claim any kind of scrutiny then?\" The Foundation is therefore sceptical about the chances for OOXML within ISO if Microsoft persists, which will be a big threat to the viablity of OOXML as an archiving standard as a whole. OOXML's role in the market as archiving standard for older Microsoft-Office generated files can also be assumed by the much more versatile Open Document Format ( ISO 26300 ), an established ISO-standard for new Office files that is broadly supported by important players like Google, IBM, Sun Microsystems, OpenOffice.org and the open source community, as well as governments like The Netherlands, Norway and South-Africa.","title":"NLnet Press-release"},

{"title":"Ted Lindgreen","description":"Ted Lindgreen Dr. Ted Lindgreen (1948) is a Dutch internet pioneer and innovator that perhaps more than any other person can be seen as the landscape architect of the early European internet. He transitioned the pioneering EUnet network from its embryonic state to a full-blown European internet infrastructure, as volunteer and later as the first managing director of NLnet foundation. After a PhD in experimental physics at Groningen, dr. Lindgreen had moved to Amsterdam to work for NIKHEF, the Netherlands Institute for Subatomic Physics. NIKHEF operated the worlds largest linear particle accelerator at the time, which meant that (like its modern day successor CERN) it needed the absolute cutting edge technology to operate. Together with Jaap Akkerhuis at CWI, dr. Lindgreen devised and set up a fiber optic network at the science campus on which they were able to run TCP/IP - one of the first such networks anywhere in the world. The network was a key part of the EUnet infrastructure. In order to avoid legal issues, NLnet first operated a closed 'members only' network, and later incorporated as a not-for-profit foundation, until a change in telecom laws allowed it greater freedom. In 1987, CWI decided they wanted to hand over management of the fibre network to another party and asked the NLUUG (the Netherlands Unix User Group) whether they could take care of this. Dr. Lindgreen was a board member, had the required experience and volunteered. When he became Managing Director of NLnet foundation in 1991, Dr. Lindgreen brought a unique combination of technical and business skills along, as well as the eagerness to make the best of these exciting new developments. At the time from an operational point of view NLnet was little more than a handful of volunteers running contributed hardware. In order to scale up, Lindgreen invested his personal life savings until that point to buy NLnet its first router from Cisco for 35.000 guilders. Lindgreen deserves the (probably globally unique) credit as the mastermind, financial backer and engineer behind succesfully breaking a country-wide monopoly which was the legal priviledge of telecom operator PTT - a the time still part of the national government. Unlike its wealthy counterpart, NLnet was a grass-roots operation without access to any subsidies or other public funding whatsoever - yet it was at the international front of technology. Lindgreen investigated and talked to many potential providers that had some form of internal network, from e.g. banking, energy companies and even technology company Philips. Ultimately he found a partner in the Dutch rail company, Nederlandse Spoorwegen. NLnet impressed the managemement of the rail company, by making several working dialup connections across the country ( VPRO in Hilversum, Knoware in Utrecht and IAF in Groningen). The modems used were low-cost devices crafted especially for NLnet, modelled after the original design created by Jaap Akkerhuis. His work ethos - working seven days a week, making long hours - and the willingness and ability to do hands-on technical work, were the kernel of huge growth for NLnet. The versatile Lindgreen placed many of the modem banks himself along the rail tracks throughout the country. He spent days crawling around the rail tracks debugging flaky connections, caused for instance by a different type of cable being used for particular parts of the trajectory - helped by his physics background and the technical expertise built up in his prior career. The deal with NS allowed NLnet to establish a superior network with full national coverage without interference or obstruction from the Netherlands PTT. Lindgreen's generous attitude of granting accesss to a generation of young internet service providers meant that end users had plenty of alternatives to choose from. NLnet's success firmly established the new business model of internet as an alternative to the traditional telecom infrastructure, and inspired many other","url":"/people/TedLindgreen.html"},

By joining forces they are able to present the key Netherlands initiatives against cyber attacks in one event. The Netherlands are an international player in the area of internet infrastructure, and because of that the country is also an attractive target for cyber attacks. At the same time The Netherlands harbours many activities in the area of ICT innovation and the online sector, industry and the public sector increasingly expand their defensive capacities against cyber crime. On October 28th a number of prominent speakers will present the key Netherlands' initiatives against cyber attacks. Among others Dick Schoof (NCTV), Gert Wabeke (KPN), Dr. Michel van Eeten (TU Delft), Barend Sluijter (NCSC), and Jan Piet Barthel (Netherlands Science Foundation/NWO) will talk about subjects such as DDoS attacks, NaWas, AbuseHub, Secure Peering, ethical hacking, Secure DNS and collaborations in the European context. The Netherlands are home to many leading iniatives in the area of internet security and robustness, often significant for the entire global sector., states Marc Gauw, general director of NLnet foundation, but the knowledge about them often remains exclusive to a limited number of stakeholders. It was time to bring it all together. Simon Besteman, Director of ISPConnect: We will give attention to the increasing abuse of internet and what the consequences are for companies and others. After that we will go into detail with some current and upcoming initiatives to fight cyber crime. With a strong programme, made possible through the support of Infradata, ASP4all, HSD, NL-ix, Surfnet, SIDN, Verisign and Ziggo, together with an abundance of networking opportunities, the organisation expects to draw over 200 visitors to De Rijtuigenloods in Amersfoort (NL). The collaboration between different parties within the online sector and the government is a good sign. Cybercrime is prominent on the agenda and luckily this initiative allows us to offer a strong platform to share IT knowledge with each other. States Michiel Steltman, Director of DHPA.

{"title":"Press release","url":"/press/20080114-formats.html","description":"Press release NLnet: Office market leader on crash course with history; Microsoft should release deprecated file formats into public domain &nbsp; [14 January 2008, Amsterdam, The Netherlands] Dutch charitative venture capitalist NLnet has requested IT company Microsoft to release its previous file formats into the public domain. According to the not-for-profit investor this will allow businesses, open source-developers and the standards community to better access their own documents in the future, and will help getting Microsoft's products to work with the new open standard ODF. Especially releasing the full blueprints of the many different versions of Microsoft's old Office formats (better known as doc, xls and ppt) into the public domain is urgently required for work on future versions of ODF. ODF (ISO&nbsp;26300) is the new and broadly supported ISO-standard for Office formats that fast becoming the default file format of choice for text editors, spreadsheets and other office applications with governments, businesses, NGO's and individuals. \"There is no reason for deprecated file formats not to be in the public domain,\" states Michiel Leenaars, strategy manager at the not-for-profit NLnet foundation. Also, over the next weeks national standards bodies worldwide are due to make up their minds about the controversial re-archiving format OOXML currently under heavy fire within the International Standards Organisation ISO. NLnet recently joined ECMA as a member to improve interoperability of future OOXML versions with the ODF standard. The foundation was alarmed by the fact that even the committee members do not get the real specifications of the file formats they are supposed to be re-encoding. \"Surely no-one can make --or judge-- a decent re-archiving standard if the original file formats are unknown to them\", says Leenaars, the longest sitting member of the Netherlands national standards body committee responsible for both ODF and OOXML. Currently Microsoft provides part of the specifications under a non-disclosure agreement (PDF) but these are vastly incomplete, illegible, and available only under very restrictive conditions --and therefore of little use to neither standards bodies nor to the software community. There has been quite some controversy over OOXML in the so far unsuccessful standardization process. Many of the technical issues still have to be resolved in line with compatibility requirements from a largely unknown format. The foundation fears that the continuation of the OOXML standardisation process without the actual specifications will result in serious misalignments and vast information loss for potentially tens of millions of customers (and former customers) from Microsoft.

Daarmee wordt de verdere uitbouw van de Nationale Wasstraat gefinancierd. NaWas is een initiatief van de Nationale Beheersorganisatie Internet Providers (NBIP) dat erop gericht is om hosting providers en middelgrote ISP’s een collectieve oplossing te bieden tegen zogenaamde DDoS aanvallen. NaWas beschikt door de bundeling van krachten over veel meer bandbreedte en geavanceerdere anti-DDoS apparatuur van verschillende merken dan voor de losse internetaanbieders of gebruikers betaalbaar is. De capaciteit voor het verwerken van aanvallen wordt door de deelnemende partijen met elkaar gedeeld. Het systeem is live sinds maart 2014, maar dient vanwege de grote interesse in de markt nu al uitgebreid te worden. NaWas voorziet duidelijk in een enorme behoefte, meldt Alex Bik, voorzitter van NBIP, Niet alleen zien we een grote vraag naar aansluitingen op NaWas, ook krijgt NBIP veel uitnodigingen om hier meer over te vertellen op conferenties omtrent het beschermen van onze nationale digitale infrastructuur. Marc Gauw, algemeen directeur van NLnet, is eveneens erg blij met dit initiatief: Dit geeft veel meer partijen dan voorheen de mogelijkheid zich goed te beschermen tegen DDoS-aanvallen, en zorgt er bovendien voor dat het verkeer van de gebruikers in Nederland blijft en niet onnodig blootgesteld wordt aan nieuwsgierige ogen van buitenlandse partijen. NBIP heeft geen winstoogmerk en biedt de NaWas-dienst tegen kostprijs aan aan zowel internetaanbieders als reguliere gebruikers.

The Officeshots project entails both an open source service framework, and a free online service based on this framework. The service is now in closed beta, exclusively available to members of the international OpenDoc Society. If you wish to join the beta program you can become a member or sponsor of the OpenDoc Society. Officeshots.org was first announced on January 29th 2009, with the beta phase of the Officeshots.org service scheduled to become active at the end of February or early March. A delay in supporting rendering factories caused the original schedule to slip but with support of NLnet, Open IT Netherlands and Abicollab.net the project is finally ready to start the beta phase. Project Lead Sander Marechal ( The Lone Wolves Foundation ): \"At the start of the beta phase, Officeshots.org is running a number of factories implementing GO-OO, OpenOffice.org, Gnumeric and AbiWord. We expect to quickly add support for a number of other factories such as Lotus Symphony, RedOffice (Chinese), OfficeReader (an ODF viewer for Symbian smart phones) and the soon to be released KOffice 2.0.\" Software vendors and user communities are encouraged to add their office solution of choice to Officeshots.org, to make its functionality available to a wider audience. So far development work within the project has concentrated on making a safe, distributed document rendering environment that allows buyers and developers to test interoperability in many different applications on many different platforms. During the closed beta the visual appearance of the main Officeshots website will be enhanced, and a translation framework so people can assist in translating Officeshots.org to their native language. The beta phase is expected to last until the beginning of June, after which the service will be available freely to anyone. Officeshots will be put to the test significantly in the first ODF Plugfest that will be held June 15/16th 2009 in The Royal Library in The Hague, where a large number of ODF implementations (including wellknown names such as Microsoft, Google, IBM and Sun, but also upcoming players like ZCubes and CelFrame Office) will test their interoperability on invitation by the Dutch cabinet in the person of Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade Frank Heemskerk.

Austrialian researchers help phones talk among each other directly The Serval BatPhone software can be used on compatible mobile phone handsets to create an alternative \"network\" where conventional mobile phone coverage has been destroyed or simply does not exist. Instead of relying on mobile phone towers, the Serval system relays calls for one mobile phone to another as either a \"closed\" network or to connect to a temporary tower.

NLnet foundation announces today that it will financially support the Unhosted project with a grant for a period of one year. Unhosted is a groundbreaking community effort to provide a safe way for users to work with web applications, by allowing the separation of software made available through the internet from their personal and business data. Unhosted makes it possible to use software served from the premises of a vendor while allowing the data to remain elsewhere - even inside the private domain of a person or organisation. Because the application and the data can meet in the browser, there is no reason to restrict data to where the software originates. \"We think Unhosted provides a novel paradigm for internet applications,\", says Michiel Leenaars, director of Strategy at NLnet foundation, \"Just like regular software doesn't impose on you where data lives, software consumed as a service should allow you to keep data where you want it too. It actually makes a lot of sense.\" \"Computers have a hard disk inside them with all your data under your control. But more and more applications are hosted online, inviting us to put our data onto their servers. Apart from our data being locked inside a place we don't have control over, many websites sell our data to third parties. This is a huge emergency in terms of consumer rights.\", says Unhosted project lead Michiel de Jong. \"As software moves to the cloud, the PC is replaced by shiny devices like the iPad and Chromebook. The iPad synchronizes with the Apple cloud, and the Chromebook synchronizes with the Google cloud. But unhosted web apps let the user decide which cloud provider they prefer. Consumers can already choose between multiple providers of commodities like electricity, telephony, and internet connection. Our protocol does the same for your remote storage. \" Unhosted was started exactly one year ago on September 9th 2010 by a group of volunteers led by Michiel de Jong, a Dutch software developer based in Berlin. The project provides both a implementation agnostic protocol - building on existing standards such as WebDAV, OAuth and Webfinger - and an SDK that can be used by applications for easy integration. In addition to the grant from NLnet foundation, Unhosted already raised 14.000 through crowdsourced funding. Acceptance of cloud applications often hinges on the trust that people have in their vendors, and Unhosted increases the options for people to use remote applications without fear of their data being used for unintended purposes. \"Unhosted takes the general idea of the cloud one step further by separating functionality, trust and storage to different places in the cloud,\" says Leenaars. \"It points us to the challenging idea that maybe the best technology provider should be just that, and not the keeper of our private and commercial secrets.\" To work on the topic in an open and vendor-neutral way, a Community Group was formed this week at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

Het fonds wil een significante impuls leveren aan de technische en operationale basis van een veiliger en stabiel internet, en de universele beschikbaarheid van hoogwaardige encryptie-software. Het fonds wordt beheerd door stichting NLnet, de algemeen nut beogende instelling die opgezet is door de Nederlandse pioniers die in de jaren tachtig het internet in Europa introduceerden. Het fonds richt zich op twee verbonden pijlers: enerzijds hoogwaardige open source-encryptie-software in de infrastructurele laag, en anderzijds ontwikkeling en versterking van de onderliggende technische internet- en webstandaarden op het gebied van encryptie. Het fonds opereert (net als het internet) internationaal. Iedere twee maanden is er weer een competetieve financieringsronde. Projecten die aanvragen indienen bij het fonds draaien (om de kans op honorering te vergroten) automatisch ook mee in de open calls&nbsp; van NLnet, die worden gefinancierd vanuit eigen middelen.Het Nederlandse Ministerie van Economische Zaken is launching partner van het fonds. Via het fonds kunnen onafhankelijke onderzoekers en ontwikkelaars stipendia aanvragen ter ondersteuning van activiteiten rondom encryptie en andere manieren om internetcommunicatie te beveiligen. Het internet afharden betekent dat we het bestendig maken tegen allerlei vormen van misbruik, zeg Marc Gauw, algemeen directeur van stichting NLnet, Cryptografie draagt de enorme verantwoordelijkheid om het internetverkeer tegen manipulatie te beschermen, en we hebben op dat punt nog een hoop in te halen. De gezondheid van het internet wordt in sterke mate bepaald door de zwakste delen. Zoals we recent hebben gezien met een aantal grootschalige aanvallen, is er nergens een veilige plek op het internet zolang er zwakheden zijn die op zeer grote schaal misbruikt kunnen worden. Met het Internet Hardening Fund kunnen we de collectieve kracht van de technische gemeenschap en het instrument van open source bundelen community om het niveau van veiligheid voor iedereen omhoog te krijgen. De Nederlandse overheid heeft de laatste tijd herhaaldelijk nadruk gelegd op de ondersteuning van open standaarden en open source, en heeft een degelijke positie aangaande de noodzaak van&nbsp; encryptie. In december 2015 onderschreef de Tweede Kamer deze positie door het unaniem aannemen van een motie van D66-Kamerlid Kees Verhoeven. De motie spoorde het kabinet aan tot steun van de open source-gemeenschap die verantwoordelijk is voor kritieke onderdelen van de internetinfrastructuur. De motie stelt dat sterke encryptie en goede beveiliging binnen het netwerk een essentiële voorwaarde voor de vrijheid en veiligheid van zowel individu als samenleving, en belangrijk is voor het beschermen van de vrijheid van meningsuiting en het beschermen van bedrijfsgeheimen. We zijn het er allemaal mee eens dat een sterk, veilig en open internet van essentieel belang is voor zowel de samenleving als de wereldeconomie zegt Marc Gauw, Het Internet Hardening Fund is opgezet om het talent van ontwikkelaars en de technische gemeenschap&nbsp; om van onderaf met oplossingen te blijven komen op een transparante en kosteneffectieve manier We hopen dat andere belanghebbenden - zowel uit de private sector als uit de publieke hoek and - de grote voordelen van deze aanpak inzien en het geweldige voorbeeld van de Nederlandse overheid zullen volgen.\" Relevante informatie Brief van minister Henk Kamp aan de Tweede Kamer","url":"/press/20161216-EZ-donation-internet-hardening.html"},

The project is part of the ARPA2 project, which is engineering towards an overall architecture scalable to run a future internet that is secure by design. Declarative web service security -- Declarative web service security in NixOS This project aims to make NixOS the first computer operating system to package TLS Pool as a service component, and will allow to combine the power of declarative packaging with the unique security characteristics of TLS Pool to create a unique delivery channel for decentralised internet applications. DIME The DIME project has three distinct goals: to make end-to-end email encryption transparent and automatic, to minimize the leakage of metadata, and to enshrine the standards which make automation resistant to manipulation by advanced persistent threats. This has led to the development of a set of protocols and data formats which combine the best of current technologies into an integrated system that gives adequate protection, yet remains flexible. It allows for people to improve their security without sacrificing functionality. getdns -- getdns - A reliable DNSSEC providing stub resolver Encrypted communication between two random end points on the internet cannot happen without additional infrastructure through which security parameters are exchanged. The getdns library is an modern asynchronous DNS library for application developers, with an API vetted by application developers. getdns has especially good stub-resolving capabilities, and has been developed alongside and in close co-operation with recent standards for stub resolving; such as DNS over TLS (RFC7858), and acquiring DNSSEC at stub resolving level (DNSSEC roadblock avoidance - RFC8027). Namecoin Namecoin is a blockchain project that provides a decentralized naming system and trust anchor. Its flagship use-case is a decentralized top-level domain (TLD) which is the cornerstone of a domain name system that is resistant to hijacking and censorship. Among other things, this provides a decentralized trust anchor for Public Key Infrastructure that does not require third party trust. It operates independent from the DNSSEC root trust chain, and can thus offer additional security under some circumstances. Pitchfork The PITCHFORK is a free/libre hardware device for compartmentalizing key material and cryptographic operations in a small and durable USB device. It uses a Cortex-M3 processor and stores all keys in the CPUs flash. The PITCHFORK has an embedded radio interface over which it can do secure key exchanges with other devices, including \"post-quantum\" cryptography. Over USB it can send and receive messages using various modern low-level crypto protocols providing different aspects of overall security. Stubby -- Stubby - A DNS Privacy enabled stub resolver Stubby is an open source project to develop a DNS stub resolver for use on client devices which will provide DNS Privacy for end users by implementing DNS-over-TLS ( RFC7858 ). This service will provide encrypted first-hop access to DNS services protecting users’ DNS queries from eavesdropping at any point along the path between their device and a privacy-enabling DNS server. TLS-KDH -- ARPA2 This project aims to implement the proposed TLS-KDH protocol into a production ready implementation. TLS-KDH is a design from Rick van Rein (ARPA2) that combines the benefits of Kerberos and Diffie-Hellman key exchange into a single unified solution that can be used to add additional security and flexibility to internet resources.

De innovatievoucherregeling is erop gericht om kennis die beschikbaar is bij kennisinstellingen nuttig te gebruiken, en daarmee innovatie bij kleine ondernemingen mogelijk te maken. Met een beetje van je tijd kun je 2.500 en/of 7.500 euro voor belangrijke projecten doneren! Nieuw is dat ook een gedeelte van de vouchers bij niet-publieke partijen (zoals bedrijven met een bepaalde expertise) uitgegeven mag worden aan bijvoorbeeld software-ontwikkeling, uiteraard onder zekere voorwaarden. De regeling is voor kleine bedrijven (van ZZP tot 250 man personeel). Het maakt niet uit in welke branche. Je kunt dus open source actief steunen met je voucher, of je nu zelfstandig kunstenaar, nagelstyliste of IT-ondernemer bent. De vouchers van de actie van vorig jaar worden op dit moment onder meer ingezet om accessibility van documenten testbaar te maken, deelname van wetenschappers in OASIS ODF TC en onderzoek te doen naar realtime collaboration voor visueel beperkten. Het is redelijk urgent: de vouchers kunnen heel snel uitverkocht zijn, dat geldt met name voor de private vouchers (die per post moeten worden aangevraagd). Als je ons wilt helpen, is het dus goed als je vandaag actie onderneemt. Wat moet ik ermee Je kunt er natuurlijk zelf direct gebruik van maken. Als je dat teveel moeite is, overweeg dan of je er een open source-project dat je gebruikt of dat op een andere manier belangrijk voor je is mee wilt steunen. Stichting NLnet legt voor de vouchers die via die stichting worden verzameld het resterende bedrag (afhankelijk van het soort voucher 33% of 50%) op tafel. Maar je kunt natuurlijk zelf ook (samen met anderen) voor een specifiek open source project een eigen inzameling houden -graag zelfs. Grote vouchers mogen tot 10 stuks gecombineerd worden, kleine helaas niet- maar daar is dan weer geen eigen bijdrage voor nodig. Je mag ieder jaar een kleine en een grote voucher aanvragen. Hoe werkt het Er zijn verschillende soorten vouchers. Voor de publieke vouchers geldt dat als je je voucher via NLnet ten goede van een project wilt laten komen, je het formuliertje op http://nlnet.nl/innovatievouchers invult. Daarna krijg je per aangevraagde voucher (twee per jaar, een klein en een groot) een mailtje dat je moet bevestigen door in te loggen met DigiD voor bedrijven. Zo'n DigiD komt overeen met je login bij de Kamer van Koophandel, je krijgt als je nog geen login hebt per post een code van hen toegestuurd. Als je die eenmaal in huis hebt, ben je met een klik klaar. De rest regelen wij met de kennisinstelling en de projecten. We vragen twee vouchers namens je aan: een grote en een kleine. Vul nu het innovatie voucher in De tweede categorie vouchers zijn de private vouchers; deze zijn voor ons nieuw en heel interessant omdat we ook niet-kennisinstellingen (bijvoorbeeld zelfstandige programmeurs of open source-gedreven kleine ondernemingen) ermee kunnen betalen om specifieke kennis die zij hebben aan open source-projecten bij te dragen. Bij private vouchers is er iets meer werk, omdat we toestemming moeten krijgen van Syntens voor ieder project. Het makkelijkst is als je het formulier dat bijgeleverd is rechtstreeks opstuurt. Dat kost je een postzegel, omdat Agentschap NL een fysiek getekende aanvraag wil -maar voor 10.000 euro richting belangrijke open source projecten is dat natuurlijk een meer dan redelijke deal. Dit geld gaat richting Nederlandse ontwikkelaars van open source, in samenspraak met Syntens. Vul voor het aanvragen van een kleine en grote private voucher het bijgeleverde formulier tweemaal in! LET OP: Het is het een of het ander: je mag een kleine en een grote voucher per jaar ontvangen, of die nu publiek of privaat zijn. Als je een postzegel ervoor over hebt, en het vandaag of morgen kunt invullen en opsturen, zijn we erg blij met private vouchers (waar je dus twee"},

AGFLs belong to the family of two level grammars, along with attribute grammars: a first, context-free level is augmented with set-valued features for expressing agreement between parts of speech. The AGFL parser includes a lexicon system that is suitable for the large lexica needed in real life NLP applications. AHA! -- Adaptive Hypermedia for All! AHA! is a general-purpose adaptive hypermedia add-on for web servers. It enables a web server to serve pages with conditionally included page fragments, and with link anchors that are conditionally colored or hidden. Adaptation is based on a domain model, a user model, and an adaptation model, using concepts, pages, fragments and condition-action rules. ALIAS -- Analysing Legal Implications and Agent Information Systems Properties associated to agents such as autonomy, pro-activity, reasoning, learning, collaboration, negotiation, and social and physical manifestation are properties developed by man. Notions such as anonymity and privacy acquire new meanings in the \"digital world.\" New concepts such as pseudo-anonymity emerge. Until now, much research on deployment of information technology has been done as a separate discipline. Computer Science and AI develop the technical expertise and applications. Law then fits these applications into existing legal frameworks (taking US, European and Dutch traditions into account), proposing new frameworks if and when needed. In this project, members of the two disciplines AI and Law are collaboratively investigating the legal possibilities and limitations of agent technology, ultimately leading to recommendations for both disciplines.

CPAN6 People are designed to collect things, whether it is food, postal stamps, or digital information. On our hard-drives, we collect software, photos, development sources, documents, music, e-mail, and much more. The typical application sees this `collecting' as secundary problem to their main task, offering little help in administering the data produced with it. CPAN6 focusses purely on this aspect, and can therefore improve the way people work in general. Global Directories A global directory is a way of retrieving contact information from others, using standard technology, so you can employ automatic tools that download and update contact information without manual intervention - or without any third parties snooping into your private or business social environment. Moreover, you can use the same technology to share any relevant information (such as keys for protection of your email) to anyone.

{"title":"Application protocols","description":"Application protocols 0cpm -- 0cpm free calling SIP is a well-established IETF standard ready to provide telephony and many other advanced services through the internet, but it seems not to be developing to its full extent. Sometimes we even see lock-in arrangements from vendors. This project aims to overcome these barriers and unleash the true power of the underlying technology platform - it designs and builds open source firmware for digital phones. The project makes full use of the exiting capabilities of DNSSEC, ZRTP and IPv6: DNSSEC secures the information looked up on remote parties; ZRTP secures conversations and if it is missing, this will be explicitly communicated to end users. Direct media streams between IPv4 endpoints can only be built up using sophisticated handling like port forwarding, but remains dependent of many factors, while IPv6 simplifies and improves SIP technology immensely. Especially the clever usage of IPv6 makes 0cpm an exiting project. Many people see IPv6 as something to avoid as long as they can because they are afraid of technical headache. This project shows that IPv6 is nothing to fear and offers exiting opportunities. For instance the fact that every RTP media stream can use random end point addresses which can be abandoned after the stream stops. Also it is possible to send IPv6 adresses of different devices in one SIP INVITE message, which is almost impossible to do behind IPv4 NAT. This will allow you to send video of a conversation to your television and simultaneously speak through your telephone. Ambulant -- Ambulant Open SMIL Player The Ambulant Open SMIL Player is an open-source, full W3C SMIL player. It is intended for researchers who need source-code access to a complete SMIL player environment. It may also be used as a stand-alone SMIL player for applications that do not need proprietary media formats. The player will support a range of SMIL profiles (including desktop and mobile configurations) and will run under Linux and Win32. A Macintosh OS-X port is also expected. The target community for the Ambulant Player are developers of multimedia protocols, networks and infrastructures. The Ambulant Player represents the first phase of a multi-year project aimed at improving network level support for multimedia information processing. As one of the results, the Ambulant team contributed considerably to the SMIL 3.0 specification. Decibel -- Open communication desktop interface Decibel (formerly known as \"OpenCDI\") provides a generic infrastructure, which integrates existing communication protocols --like any plugin based solution would do-- without the need for an application which presents everything in one user interface. It creates components and services, each optimized for a special task (or role). When a component realizes user interaction, the service will provide the technology. A service-based architecture will interconnect components to fulfill a given task. Internet of Coins -- Internet of Coins Internet of Coins is an environment for personal finance. As a decentralized open source platform it enables an optimally inclusive financial network, interlinking all digital forms of value. It allows you to trade digital assets and currencies peer to peer, with an easy to use interface and the opportunity to earn fees by participating as an allocator.

{"description":"SOS Internet Supporting an Open & Stable Internet On January 11th 2012 the court in Amsterdam issued a judgement that has major consequences for the internet as we know it in The Netherlands. As of February 1st 2012 internet providers XS4all and Ziggo should make it impossible for their users to reach a certain web community (\"The Pirate Bay\"). A blockade like - while simple on paper - that has many implications. From now on every internet packet that is sent through those providers has to be screened whether or not it comes from or goes to a blacklisted destination - with all the complexity and instability that invokes. That severly disadvantages all users of the internet in the Netherlands - and not just the visitors of those sites. That can't be right. We are convinced that with the right information the higher court will deny this case, but it will take years. The case itself is not isolated: the organisation BREIN, representing a number of content providers, has meanwhile written letters to other Dutch internet providers based on the current verdict, and easily has the financial means to go to court in each and every of those cases. That means a flood of legal cases against also smaller (and less financially endowed) internet providers - with the risk of this failing big time somewhere. It nothing happens, the quality and usability of the internet will go down. We should not allow that to happen. These are lawsuits that are aimed at internet providers, but they are by far not the only stakeholders in them. Everybody in the Netherlands will have to endure the outcomes of these important legal procedures, with potentially a lot of damage to society - and to our economy. That is why the initiative was taken to set up a special support fund to help represent the interests of internet users in these legal proceedings. By setting up this fund ( with the apt title Support [fund] Open & Stable Internet, or in Dutch 'Steunfonds Open en Stabiel Internet') we want to make it possible to have adequate means to let the voice of ten million Netherlands internet users (and that not even includes future generations). We want money to be available for (scientific and technical) research and other activities that could be of importance in these cases. The money shall not go to the legal defence of XS4all and Ziggo, but to independent initiatives from society serving these legal procedures. That is the only way that we can prevent a very undesirable legal precedent to be established. SOS Internet is managed professionally at no cost by NLnet foundation, the charity that thirty years ago initiated the internet as we know it in the Netherlands. Applications will be evaluated by a committee led by Marleen Stikker (Waag Society), Simon Hania (former CTO XS4all) and Hendrik Rood (Advisor Internet architecture and technology). Of course without remuneration. Read the press release With a small donation and helping us spread the message you will already be helping us tremendously. Together we strive for an open and stabile internet. And we do need your help. Your donation will be handled by NLnet Foundation, a well-known registered internet charity that operates globally.

{"description":"\"Research and Higher Education Technology Fund\" kickstarted Vietsch Foundation and NLnet cooperate in internet R&D for research and education Amsterdam, September 28th 2016 &mdash; The Netherlands based Vietsch Foundation makes the first donation to the Research and Higher Education Technology Fund. The new thematic fund is managed by NLnet foundation, a public benefit organisation founded in 1989 with the mission to promote the exchange of electronic information. As a framework for this initiative, the two organisations have signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding collaboration possibilities. Our mission is to promote research and development of advanced Internet technology, services, processes for scientific research and higher education, states Valentino Cavalli, chairman of the Vietsch foundation. and NLnet has the same goals but for the entire internet community, so the collaboration is quite a natural match. The broad experience in supporting open source projects related to network technology and the extensive network of NLnet Foundation built over decades extends our own operational capabilities. And of course we hope that our example will inspire others to contribute to the Research and Higher Education Technology Fund, because it really delivers a lot of value for money. NLnet Foundation has a long history in supporting projects around the world that contribute to a free, secure and robust Internet, adds Marc Gauw, chairman of Board of NLnet. There is an overwhelming need for the type of small-scale funding NLnet provides, clearly also from the Research and Education network community. Contrary to popular expectation (and perhaps commons sense) there is only very limited funding available for independent contributions in the area of internet infrastructure. So important and urgent projects actually struggle to get funded, which is a loss for everybody. Through the new fund and the launching contribution of Vietsch Foundation, we are now able to select and award additional project proposals - which is of course wonderful. The Vietsch Foundation was created by an endowment from the late dr. W. Karel Vietsch, who was the Secretary General of TERENA, the Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association. Karel was very involved in the Internet community, says dr. ir. Antoinette Vietsch, member of the Board of Trustees at Vietsch Foundation. He spent a large part of his life working in the area of research and education networking, which he help developing with his energy, creativity and thorough methodical approach.

{"description":"Reports and studies Assessing Cyber Security Over the years, a plethora of reports has emerged that assess the causes, dynamics, and effects of cyber threats. This proliferation of reports is an important sign of the increasing prominence of cyber attacks for organizations, both public and private, and citizens all over the world. In addition, cyber attacks are drawing more and more attention in the media. Such efforts can help to better awareness and understanding of cyber threats and pave the way to improved prevention, mitigation, and resilience. This report aims to help in this task by assessing what we know about cyber security threats based on a review of 70 studies published by public authorities, companies, and research organizations from about 15 countries over the last few years. It answers the following questions: what do we know about the number, origin, and impact of cyber attacks? What are the current and emerging cyber security trends? And how well are we prepared to face these threats? The focus of the examined reports differs widely. Some reports look at all possible cyber attacks, others zoom in on specific threats such as Distributed Denial of Service attacks or malware. Some reports focus on a specific sector, or one country, others have a global scope. Methodologies used by the reports are often inconsistent and sometimes opaque: some are based on self-reporting (e.g., surveys), while others use data generated by software. One of the main observations of our study is that the range of estimates in the examined investigations is so wide, even experts find it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. This leads to the conclusion that, although there is no shortage in the number of reports, well defined and comparable cyber threat data and risk assessments are missing. Download the report or view in the browser. NOMA -- Network Operator Measurements Activity The Network Operator Measurement Activity — NOMA — is exploring the possibility of developing operator-driven network health measurements. NOMA aims to establish a platform for collaboration on the initial definition, collection and dissemination of operator network measurements (self-instrumentation), with a goal of ensuring a better, shared understanding of what “good” Internet looks like. This will allow new networks brought online to determine that they are well aligned with that target, and will give operators a better sense of when their networks are healthy or underperforming.

{"description":"Privacy and security Anomos Anomos introduces a layer of security and anonymity currently absent in peer to peer file sharing protocols. Through the study of cryptography and anonymous networks such as TOR, a system is being designed which allows any individual to safely distribute files to a large audience without fear of legal or social repercussions. This technology is an important part of modern free society, and a tool which may be used around the world to bring about positive social change. With Anomos, one can distribute the file anonymously to thousands of people at once. Because Anomos is based on BitTorrent, each download makes the network faster, more robust, and harder to eliminate. This technology can benefit thousands of people all around the world, to those who live in religiously oppressive places, those to whom the mere accusation of apostasy or sexual deviance could be life threatening; to mash-up artists concerned about copyright infringement, or anyone fearful that their actions on the Internet may lead to unjust punishment. First and foremost, Anomos has been designed as a tool for free speech. Cryptech.is Cryptech.is is a project that want to design an open-source hardware cryptographic engine that can be built by anyone from public hardware specifications and open-source firmware. Anyone can then operate it without fees of any kind. DIFR-TSPM -- DIFR Tag-Scan-Privacy-Match Increasingly, products for sale in shops are being tagged by RFID tags. These tags contain a unique product or item number, which can be read out wirelessly over a short distance by an RFID reader. Their function in shops and supermarkets is similar to the ubiquitous paper barcode, except that RFID tags can also be read out if the tag is not in plain sight of the reader. This means these tags can also be read out surreptitiously when walking around the store, or afterwards when the items are in your shopping bag and you are walking on the street. This also holds true for payment cards and travel passes (e.g. the OV chipcard in the Netherlands) that people carry with them. This has raised concerns about the impact for RFID technology on the privacy in our society. The goal of the project is to develop a demonstrator of a different way to inform consumers about the RFID tags on the items they buy or the tags that surround them in their environment. Main idea is to use a mobile phone to display information about RFID tags in the vicinity. In particular, the setup of the demonstrator will operate as follows. A consumer sets his privacy preferences in a profile stored on his mobile phone. If he holds the phone close to a product in a shop containing an RFID tag, the phone will read the tag number from the tag. It will then query (over the Internet, either through GPRS, UMTS or WiFi) the backoffice to retrieve the privacy policy corresponding to the tag number. Then it will match the tag policy with the consumer policy, and present the result of the match to the consumer on the display of the mobile phone in an intuitive and appealing manner. This demonstrator will be used to show how such a concept: empowers users in deciding for themselves how their privacy is affected and how to respond to that information, and allows producers to efficiently communicate their privacy policy to consumers. DNSSEC-mail Until recent developments of domain name authentication, Internet mail has not had access to scalable mechanisms for validating an identity associated with a message. Any identifier could be used fraudulently. The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) are relatively new technologies that create a foundational change by validating domain identifiers. However they are only the first step. DMARC takes additional steps in allowing domain owners to publish statements about their email use of their identifiers and DMARC facilitates much easier operational reporting from mail recipients to domain owners.

{"description":"Persbericht Den Haag, 28 oktober 2014 This article in English Nieuw wapen in de strijd tegen DDoS aanvallen gelanceerd Nederland heeft vanaf vandaag een voorziening voor zeer zware DDos aanvallen. Het 'Trusted Networks Initiative' maakt het mogelijk een deel van het internet tijdelijk van het buitenland af te sluiten om de aanval af te slaan, terwijl belangrijke websites wel bereikbaar blijven voor bijvoorbeeld Nederlandse consumenten. Dit initiatief wordt vandaag 28 oktober tijdens het evenement 'Holland Strikes Back' gelanceerd, waar toonaangevende sprekers de belangrijkste Nederlandse innovaties tegen cybercriminaliteit presenteren. Het idee voor het 'Trusted Networks Initiative is ontwikkeld door internetstimuleringsfonds NLnet and internet exchange NL-ix, in samenwerking met het nationale veiligheidscluster The Hague Security Delta, met als doel economische schade van deze cyberaanvallen te beperken en de overlast bij consumenten te verminderen. Het product dat we uiteindelijk met partners uit de financi&euml;le sector en internet operators sector ontwikkeld hebben, is daarnaast ook een innovatie die internationaal vermarkt kan worden en waarmee we Nederland internationaal op de kaart kunnen zetten op het gebied van Cyber Security, aldus Rob de Wijk, algemeen directeur The Hague Security Delta. Trusted Networks Initiative Het 'Trusted Networks Initiative' classificeert websites en netwerken als 'trusted' en helpt hen onderscheid te maken tussen 'betrouwbaar' en 'minder betrouwbaar' Internet, om in geval van een DDoS aanval het onbetrouwbare internet af te kunnen sluiten. Dit project is daarmee een alternatief voor de poging een 'Nationaal Noodnet' te cre&euml;ren, die nog niet tot resultaat heeft geleid, en is niet in strijd met beginselen van netneutraliteit omdat iedere website zelf op ieder moment kan besluiten of een DDoS aanval zo groot is dat een deel van het Internet beter kan worden afgesloten. \"Het idee blinkt uit in eenvoud\" Cyberdreigingen vormen inmiddels een significant risico voor de samenleving, Het World Economic Forum (WEF) waarschuwde nog niet zolang geleden zelfs tegen een mogelijke 'cybergeddon' in haar jaarlijkse risicobeoordeling[1], stelt Rob De Wijk, algemeen directeur The Hague Security Delta (HSD). Wij zijn er dan ook trots op dat we met HSD mede initiatiefnemer zijn van een van de veelbelovende oplossingen om de risico's flink terug te brengen. Het idee blinkt eigenlijk uit in eenvoud: al in de middeleeuwen haalde men simpelweg de ophaalbrug op in geval de vijand aan de poort stond, aldus Marc Gauw, directeur van Stichting NLnet. De enige uitdaging bestaat nu wel nog uit de bewustwording dat men dit soort oplossingen moet implementeren v&oacute;&oacute;r een incident plaatsvindt, en niet pas erna. Als een van de initiatiefnemers is NL-ix zeer verheugd om nu als eerste de 'Trusted Routing' te kunnen aanbieden via onze internet exchange, zo meldt Jan Hoogenboom, CEO van NL-ix. In deze eerste fase kunnen geïnteresseerde kritische websites zich laten classificeren als 'Trusted Network', zo alvast ervaring opdoen met dit concept, om daarna de oplossing naar meer partijen en ook internationaal uit te breiden.

{"description":"OV-chip 2.0 Radboud Universiteit ontwikkelt open source OV-chipkaart \"OV-chip 2.0 moet privacy beschermen\" Amsterdam, 19 juni 2008 [ This press release in English ] De Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen gaat zich het komende anderhalf jaar bezighouden met de ontwikkeling van een nieuwe generatie privacyvriendelijke chipkaarten voor het openbaar vervoer op basis van open source-technologie. Deze kaarten zullen gebruik maken van moderne cryptografische technieken waardoor reizigers wel een gepersonaliseerde kaart kunnen kopen --met specifieke kortingsmogelijkheden-- maar niet al hun reisgedrag getraceerd wordt. De universiteit heeft voor het onderzoek een eenmalige beurs gekregen van de Nederlandse filantropische stichting NLnet. \"Met het falen van de eerste generatie OV-chipkaart in Nederland dreigt een enorme desinvestering,\" stelt Michiel Leenaars, directeur strategie van stichting NLnet en zelf fervent OV-reiziger. \"Door de ontwikkeling in een open context over te doen, hopen we de basis te leggen voor een volgende generatie OV-chipkaart in Nederland die wel stand houdt en die het volledige vertrouwen van de consument kan dragen\". De stichting wil samen met de universiteit er zorg voor dragen dat niet alleen misbruik van de kaart tegengegaan wordt maar ook dat de privacy van de reizigers technisch gegarandeerd kan worden. Het onderzoek aan de Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen zal uitgevoerd worden binnen de Digital Security groep, onder leiding van Prof. dr. Bart Jacobs en dr. Wouter Teepe. Deze groep is eerder dit jaar in het nieuws geweest vanwege het analyseren van zwakheden in chipkaarten die op dit moment veel gebruikt worden. De onderzoekers willen zich in hun onderzoek en experimenteerwerk erop richten om te zien of de vereiste privacyvriendelijke technieken ook daadwerkelijk geschikt zijn voor een efficiente en veilige implementatie op chipkaarten --en in andere systemen zoals mobiele telefoons of zakcomputers. Alle ontwikkelde software voor de OV-chip v2.0 zal \"open source\" zijn en in principe voor iedereen toegankelijk, bijvoorbeeld om te controleren of reis- en persoonsgegevens inderdaad adekwaat beschermd worden. Open source software heeft niet alleen in de academische wereld maar in toenemende mate ook daarbuiten, met name bij de overheid, de voorkeur boven gesloten software (waarvan de werking geheim is).","url":"/press/20080619-ovkaart.html","title":"OV-chip 2.0"},

It also comes with features that are not present in competing products, most notably support for real time document collaboration through the AbiCollab plugin. The AbiCollab plugin allows multiple people to work on-line on the same document at the same time. This eliminates the error prone practice of sending document updates over email to co-authors to keep everyone in sync. AbiCollab is designed to be transport protocol independent. It currently supports collaborating over plain TCP, XMPP/Jabber, the OLPC mesh network and over the AbiCollab.net service. This project aims creation of two additional AbiCollab transport backends. The first would use the Telepathy framework. The second AbiCollab backend would be based on the SIP SIMPLE client SDK. AbiMacOS -- Abiword for MacOS Within the scope of this project the open and free word processor AbiWord will be ported to MacOS platform and submitted to the AppStore. AbiRDF -- Abiword RDF NLnet strives to broaden the footnote of the ODF standard. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is one of the distinguishing features of ODF. The project is to enhance the existing RDF support in Abiword. Many use cases which are highly user oriented are being handled: drag and drop, sidepanels, notifications, stylesheets, and hookups to Web services. Allowing SPARQL queries will significantly enhance the possibility of ODF for real time collaboration. AbiRDF2 -- Abiword RDF Abiword is an open source word processing application with advanced collaboration features. The project is to improve RDF support in abiword with the goal of increasing user adoption and interest in the technology. The following improvements are foreseen: Support for office:annotation-end in Abiword's ODF handling C++ Semantic Objects which relate to common RDF vocabularies. Drag and Drop to/from Semantic Objects Presenting drag and drop possibilities, both from other applications into an ODF file, and from an ODF file to other applications, should entice users to see ODF as a solid single file container for storage and transmission of not only words but also semantics. Calligra-SVG -- Calligra load fallback The ODF standard specifies that a draw:frame can contain text boxes, ODF objects, binary objects, images, applets, plug-ins or floating frames. No current ODF-handling application can handle all of these. The standard anticipates this and specifies a fall-back mechanism by recommending to include an image representation of the object into the frame in addition to the object itself. The image specification does not limit the formats for the images but recommends that vector graphics are stored in the SVG format and bitmap graphics in the PNG format. We propose to improve the fallback mechanism for unsupported objects in the Calligra suite. Calligra-Windows -- Calligra to Windows The Calligra project is an ambitious new take on productivity and creativity. Built on the powerfull cross-platform QT and KDE technology platforms, it offers a complete open source office suite that sports exciting new features and offers excellent support of the OpenDocument Format.

{"description":"NoScript wins grant NLnet congratulates NoScript for winning 2011 Security Innovation Grant The Dragon Research Group (DRG) has announced that the 2011 Security Innovation Grant award goes to NoScript, a unique and popular browser extension that helps limit security and privacy threats. The award is given to the most innovative project in the area of information security. This award recognizes and supports novel projects providing non-commercial and open-source solutions to Internet security challenges. NLnet Foundation wants to congratulate the development team of NoScript, and project lead developer Giorgio Maone, in particular. \"In the modern web we are now at a point where complete operating systems have been shown to run wholly inside the browser,\" says Michiel Leenaars, director of strategy at NLnet foundation. \"Combine that with the fact that the web was not primarily designed for security but grew from openness and extensibility, and you will come to the conclusion that the protection offered by NoScript is essential if we want to keep control over our own devices. With the world population adopting and partially moving to mobile devices, this becomes even more urgent\" NoScript is a GPL-licensed project that has been the recipient of two development grants from NLnet. The Security Innovation Grant is a private initiative from the Dragon Research Group, and the winner of the award is chosen by an independent selection committee drawn from the DRG Advisory Council. The selection committee is supported by input from an independent review committee made up of industry experts from the information security community. Award candidate submissions are open to the public with the review committee evaluating submissions according to the award guidelines and project criteria. Upon learning of NoScript's selection as this year's award winner, Giorgio Maone, the NoScript project leader thanked the selection committee for recognizing NoScript. \"This is a great honor and a spur to keep making the Web a safer place. I feel the urge to thank the committee for recognizing NoScript as a pioneering force in browser security, and the community of contributors, researchers, translators, beta testers, and loyal users who keep this project alive day after day.\" On his personal blog hackademix.net, Giorgio went on to describe specific development plans and goals for NoScript in the coming months. Patrick Green, DRG Advisory Council Chair and Manager of Networks and Telecommunications at the University of Warwick, speaking on behalf of the selection committee said \"It has been a great pleasure to be involved with this very important grant fund&nbsp;- we had a very strong list of candidates for the grant, and it was very difficult to chose a recipient.

Beiden speelden een voortrekkersrol in de totstandkoming van het internet in Europa, met een impact ver daarbuiten. Hagen nam in 1982 het initiatief voor de oprichting van EUnet, en nam vanuit het toenmalige Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam de leiding bij de opbouw van dit pan-Europese computernetwerk dat al snel transatlantische verbindingen aanging en daarna overging naar het in Amerika opkomende internetprotocol. In 1986 werd hij voorzitter van stichting NLnet en werd de eerste commerciele 'Internet Service Provisie' in ons land een feit. De commerciele activiteiten van NLnet werden in 1997 verkocht en met de opbrengst ging stichting NLnet met Hagen als algemeen directeur verder als een gerespecteerde charitatieve instelling die wereldwijd de ontwikkeling van het open internet stimuleert. Kees Neggers stond aan de basis van een aantal belangrijke internationale organisaties in de internetwereld, waaronder RARE, Internet Society, RIPE NCC, Ebone, CCIRN, de Amsterdam Internet Exchange en GLIF. Neggers vormde samen met Boudewijn Nederkoorn vanaf 1988 de directie van het Nederlandse SURFnet. Onder hun leiding dwong SURFnet wereldwijd erkenning af voor haar internationale voorlopersrol en het onderzoeks- en onderwijsnetwerk groeide in die periode uit tot een van de meest geavanceerde en gerespecteerde ter wereld. Neggers werd een jaar geleden voor zijn verdiensten al onderscheiden als Officier in de Orde van Oranje-Nassau. Met Hagen en Neggers komt het totaal Nederlandse internetpionieers in de Internet Hall of Fame op drie. Vorig jaar werd in Geneve de in Duitsland geboren Nederlander Daniel Karrenberg al opgenomen, als jongste van slechts vijf Europeanen.

Aan de geinternationaliseerde versie van de softwarelicentie is meer dan vijf jaar gewerkt, de financien hiervoor kwamen voor een deel uit Nederland. \"De economische impact van open source neemt steeds sterker toe, zowel zichtbaar als onzichtbaar ingebakken in apparaten,\" zo stelt prof. dr. mr. Kees Stuurman, hoogleraar aan de UvT en een van de organisatoren van de conferentie. \"We willen het kennisniveau in Nederland hiermee op dit punt daarom een serieuze impuls geven. Het gaat om een industrie met een omvang van vele miljarden, en de groei neemt alleen maar toe\". GPL is geen los product maar een internationaal juridisch raamwerk waarmee programmeurs hun werk in ruil voor het onbeperkt gebruik van het werk van anderen kostenloos ter beschikking stellen. \"De meeste Nederlanders hebben leggen geen verband tussen copyright en bijvoorbeeld mobiele telefoons of computersoftware, maar dat verband is heel direct\", zo stelt Michiel Leenaars, directeur strategie van maatschappelijk investeerder NLnet en een van de sprekers tijdens het evenement. \"De GPL zorgt er ironisch genoeg via het copyright voor dat het intellectueel eigendom van iedereen blijft\". De GPL-familie van licenties vormt de basis van veel moderne software, zoals het besturingssysteem Linux, OpenOffice.org, de programmeertaal Java en tekenpakket GIMP. Ook veel commerciele bedrijven werken inmiddels op grote schaal met GPL-toepassingen, in Nederland zijn dat onder meer TomTom, Oce en Irex. Tijdens de conferentie in Tilburg op 19 september worden naast de belangrijkste vernieuwingen in de open source licenties ook de verhoudingen met het Nederlands en Europees recht onder de loep genomen.

The project is part of the ARPA2 project, which is engineering towards an overall architecture scalable to run a future internet that is secure by design. Declarative web service security -- Declarative web service security in NixOS This project aims to make NixOS the first computer operating system to package TLS Pool as a service component, and will allow to combine the power of declarative packaging with the unique security characteristics of TLS Pool to create a solid and versatile delivery channel for decentralised internet applications. DIME The DIME project has three distinct goals: to make end-to-end email encryption transparent and automatic, to minimize the leakage of metadata, and to enshrine the standards which make automation resistant to manipulation by advanced persistent threats. This has led to the development of a set of protocols and data formats which combine the best of current technologies into an integrated system that gives adequate protection, yet remains flexible. It allows for people to improve their security without sacrificing functionality. getdns -- getdns - A reliable DNSSEC providing stub resolver Encrypted communication between two random end points on the internet cannot happen without additional infrastructure through which security parameters are exchanged. The getdns library is an modern asynchronous DNS library for application developers, with an API vetted by application developers. getdns has especially good stub-resolving capabilities, and has been developed alongside and in close co-operation with recent standards for stub resolving; such as DNS over TLS (RFC7858), and acquiring DNSSEC at stub resolving level (DNSSEC roadblock avoidance - RFC8027). Namecoin Namecoin is a blockchain project that provides a decentralized naming system and trust anchor. Its flagship use-case is a decentralized top-level domain (TLD) which is the cornerstone of a domain name system that is resistant to hijacking and censorship. Among other things, this provides a decentralized trust anchor for Public Key Infrastructure that does not require third party trust. It operates independent from the DNSSEC root trust chain, and can thus offer additional security under some circumstances.

{"description":"Certificates through DNSSEC Dutch students produce improved security mechanism for the web [Press release, Amsterdam (NL), February 9th 2011] Two student researchers doing an internship at NLnet Foundation have produced a working, inexpensive solution to protect internet users against certain forms of identity theft in the browser. Web site operators traditionally rely on often expensive and awkward browser certificates to protect the communication with their users against abuse, but over the last five years the technical community at large has become increasingly aware that this system is still wide open to abuse. The solution presented by Danny Groenewegen and Pieter Lange from the University of Amsterdam is to make use of the possibilities offered by the recently upgraded domain name system of the internet (DNS) to automatically let the browser of the end user verify certificates through an independent and secure channel. This validation through the so called 'trust chain' of DNSSEC does not only provide more security for users --at no cost to them-- but also gives web site owners more freedom to deploy the cryptography of their choice. In addition to the security benefits the new method significantly lowers operation cost for deployment for owners of web sites, because everyone can now set up a completely secure website instantly in an automated way, rather than the current more complex method where they depend on external parties. \"Once a not entirely trustworthy certificate authority is included in browsers, it can silently generate valid certificates for any domain on the planet. It is like a bank handing out money from your bank account as soon as a piece of paper with your bank account number and a human signature on it says it is okay --without checking who signed it,\" says Michiel Leenaars, director of Strategy at NLnet foundation. A rogue certificate is not visible without additional manual steps, and a website identifying itself with a rogue certificate even produces the same reassuring 'padlock' that users are taught to trust. The system proposed and built by the students from the University of Amsterdam recognises these rogue certficates based on their unique fingerprint published in DNS, and is able to shield the user from impersonators --so called man-in-the-middle attacks. In the recent hijack of social network Facebook in Tunisia in January 2011, it became obvious that when the Tunisian government sought to gain access to user accounts from citizens it could use the certificates of its own certificate authority (Certification.tn) to intercept seemingly protected traffic. A number of other governments --including the Dutch, Japanese and Taiwanese government-- as well as private companies and security researchers have successfully registered their own CA and these are now part of the large set of trusted certificate authorities in various modern browsers. \"Access to an actual Certificate Authority is not even required to create a rogue certicate, as another option is to modify valid certificates issued by Certificate Authorities that still use outdated cryptographic technologies\", says prof. Cees de Laat of the University of Amsterdam, \"sometimes such use of weak cryptography is intentional, as the name of one such Certificate Authority ( MD5 collisions inc .) points out\". In security terms a cryptography collision is the situation where two certificates share the same fingerprint. Although the current amount of lost data and identity theft through this type of attacks is unknown, a recent global survey by the Electronic Frontier Foundation of the entire publicly reachable web (also sponsored by NLnet foundation) found many worrying examples of abuse of SSL certificates out in the wild. With a rogue certificate it becomes possible to perform a successful man-in-the-middle-attack, which include running software on your local computer as well as criminals intercepting sensitive internet applications such as","url":"/press/20110209-secweb.html","title":"Certificates through DNSSEC"},

WireGuard has been designed in many ways to contrast with poor architectural decisions of popular but aged VPN technologies like IPsec and OpenVPN. IPsec may be academically pristine in its laying responsibilities, but the complexity of this makes it nearly impossible to deploy or implement securely. OpenVPN is similarly a monstrous codebase, relying on the error-prone DTLS protocol and uses 90s constructions.

Using these Hidden Services, critical political and human rights information can be published in a way that both the publisher and users of the service are protected from identification. The current version of Tor Hidden Services has a number of drawbacks that hamper the active use of this important feature. The most serious limitation is the performance: the time it takes until a Hidden Service gets registered in the network and the latency of contact establishment when being accessed by a user. Due to design issues in the original Tor protocol, the connection to a new Hidden Service can take several minutes, leading most users to give up before the connection has been established. Using the Tor Hidden Services for direct interactive user-to-user communication (like for instant messaging) is nearly impossible due to this high latency in the Hidden Service circuit setup. An evolution of the Tor protocol is proposed to speed up the Tor Hidden Services. The improved protocol will change the way circuits are set up. The end goal is to have the protocol change production ready and propagated to the Tor users within nine months. The resulting software will be published under the GPL license, like the rest of the Tor code. All deliverables will be fully public. The project's own website"},

Kerberos lends itself well to infrastructure-supported mutual authentication, and can even be used to crossover between realms. A downside of this infrastructure is that a crack of one key can lead to a cascade of reverse-engineered keys. Diffie-Hellman key exchange, nowadays primarily in its Elliptic-Curve variation, can be used to incorporate the desirable property of Forward Secrecy, but its vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks must then be overcome by cryptographically binding it to an authentication mechanism. The project will create a production quality implementation based on the open source GnuTLS codebase. The project's own website ARPA2 is a coherent, longer term open source project thoughtfully engineering towards an overall architecture scalable to run the future internet that is secure by design. It brings together proven technologies, new insights and talented people to solve the hard challenges. The TLS-KDH specification describes how Kerberos data structures can be used for TLS client authentication, by introducing a new certificate type for use with TLS. The server can choose to provide a Certificate with a traditional signing mechanism such as RSA for authentication, in which case this specification speaks of a KDH-enhanced exchange; even when presenting no server certificate at all, a client-side Kerberos ticket can be used for mutual authentication in what will then be called a KDH-only exchange. The KDH-enhanced variety uses existing CipherSuite, and KDH-only defines new CipherSuites. Both KDH-enhanced and KDH-only message flows are referred to as TLS- KDH. Earlier work on TLS-KDH was funded with a joint subsidy from NLnet and the programme \"[veilig] door innovatie\" from the Netherlands government.

This particular project prototypes a \"helper device\" for long-range WiFi. Serval has developed various technologies that allow voice calls, SMS, file sharing and other services in a completely distributed manner. Robust security is being progressively introduced into these technologies, with voice calls already enjoying end to end encryption, and our UDP-like Mesh Datagram Protocol (MDP) also enjoying automatic encryption. The Serval Project is intended to be useful in disaster and emergency situations anywhere in the world, as well as for people in rural, remote and developing world settings where traditional cellular service may not be available or may be too expensive. The Serval Project's technologies also have obvious application to enabling freedom of speech and communications for people under oppressive regimes. Serval currently uses ad-hoc WiFi on mobile phones to form the mesh network. This requires root access on Android, and is unlikely to ever be possible on iPhone. Also, ad-hoc WiFi, while useful, has many limitations, including limited range and relatively high power consumption. This particular project aims to prototype a \"helper device\", that would consist of a WiFi-enabled Arduino-compatible device attached to a low-cost radio module, and then to integrate that hardware with the Serval platform.

One of these problems is certainly related to shortcomings of its Linux implementation (\"LKSCTP\"), which cause it to perform much worse than TCP under most circumstances.

The two most important TCP features that are not required according to the standard are missing in LKSCTP: auto-buffer tuning and pluggable congestion control.

{"url":"/project/qubes/","description":"Qubes [Qubes -- till 2017/07/01] Qubes OS is a security-oriented operating system (OS). Qubes is free and open-source software (FOSS). This means that everyone is free to use, copy, and change the software in any way. It also means that the source code is openly available so others can contribute to and audit it. The project's own website Most people use an operating system like Windows or OS X on their desktop and laptop computers. These OSes are popular because they tend to be easy to use and usually come pre-installed on the computers people buy. However, they present problems when it comes to security. For example, you might open an innocent-looking email attachment or website, not realizing that you’re actually allowing malware (malicious software) to run on your computer. Depending on what kind of malware it is, it might do anything from showing you unwanted advertisements to logging your keystrokes to taking over your entire computer. This could jeopardize all the information stored on or accessed by this computer, such as health records, confidential communications, or thoughts written in a private journal. Malware can also interfere with the activities you perform with your computer. For example, if you use your computer to conduct financial transactions, the malware might allow its creator to make fraudulent transactions in your name. Qubes takes an approach called security by compartmentalization, which allows you to compartmentalize the various parts of your digital life into securely isolated compartments called qubes. This approach allows you to keep the different things you do on your computer securely separated from each other in isolated qubes so that one qube getting compromised won’t affect the others. For example, you might have one qube for visiting untrusted websites and a different qube for doing online banking. This way, if your untrusted browsing qube gets compromised by a malware-laden website, your online banking activities won’t be at risk. Similarly, if you’re concerned about malicious email attachments, Qubes can make it so that every attachment gets opened in its own single-use disposable qube. In this way, Qubes allows you to do everything on the same physical computer without having to worry about a single successful cyberattack taking down your entire digital life in one fell swoop.

Currently the OV-chipkaart is being tested in practice in and around Rotterdam and Amsterdam. National introduction has been postponed a couple of times, but is now foreseen in 2009. Early 2008 the OV-chipkaart has come under heavy attack because of both security and privacy concerns: Individual travel movements are collected centrally and will be used for direct marketing purposes. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens, CBP) has therefore described the approach as: not in accordance with the law (CBP report). The cryptographic protection in the Mifare Classic chipcard, used in the personalised cards is broken. The throw-away cards have been cloned, enabling free travel. Very little is known about how the system actually works, and about how (private) data are protected.

The project's own website MSRP protocol (draft-ietf-simple-message-sessions) is work items of the SIP SIMPLE (SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions) Working Group of the IETF, currently in the RFC queue (approved standard). At the moment, SIP SIMPLE lacks Open Source implementations, which hinders its adoption. One major components of the SIP SIMPLE framework is MSRP (The Message Session Relay Protocol) which implements session based Interactive Messaging, file transfers, and other media sharing between SIP devices. A complete MSRP suite consists of the following three components: Multi-party Instant Message (IM) server (this project) MSRP relay ( under development ) MSRP client (future development) The Multi-party Instant Message Sessions MSRP MSRP ( IETF specification ) defines a mechanism for sending instant messages within a peer-to-peer session, negotiated using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This document defines the necessary tools for establishing multi-party instant messaging (IM) sessions, or chat rooms, with MSRP. The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) ( IETF specification ) defines a mechanism for sending a series of instant messages within a session. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in combination with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC3264] allows for two peers to establish and manage such sessions. In another application of SIP, a user agent can join in a multi-party session or conference that is hosted by a specialized user agent called a conference focus [RFC4353]. Such a conference can naturally involve an MSRP session as one of possibly many media components. It is the responsibility of an entity handling the media to relay instant messages received from one participant to the rest of the participants in the conference. Several such proprietary systems already exist in the Internet. Participants in a chat room can be identified with a pseudonym or nickname, and decide whether their real identity is disclosed to other participants. Participants can also use a rich set of features, such as the ability to send private instant messages to one or more participants, and the ability to establish sub-conferences with one or more of the participants within the existing conference. They also allow combining instant messaging with other media components, such as voice, video, white-boarding, screen sharing, and file transfer. Such conferences are already available today with other technologies different than MSRP; they are however not integrated with SIP protocol. For example, Internet Relay Chat (IRC)[RFC2810], Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [RFC3920] based chat rooms, and many other proprietary systems provide this kind of functionality. It makes sense to specify equivalent functionality for MSRPbased systems to both provide competitive features as well as enable interlocking between the systems and compatibility with SIP deployments.

The MSRP relay is necessary to ensure communication for clients located behind NAT and the MSRP IM chat server can include the MSRP Relay component to provide ubiquitous access for clients outside or behind NAT devices.

Besides a modular code base that is better suited for modern multiprotocol networking environments, the nftables project aims to introduce powerful new userspace tools which will allow users to dynamically perform packet filtering on custom protocols (including but not limited to new proposed internet standards as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force). Existing packet filtering solutions would require a recompiled kernel module in the same situation. The end result is that users will have more autonomy on what gets filtered and how, which make them less dependent on the technical choices of vendors and communities. The nftables project has been accepted in Linux mainstream kernel. The project's own website Nftables provides a framework that can potentially replace all existing duplicated Linux packet classification frameworks such as BPF, {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables and tc. As a proof to the community, the project will implement support for filter raw socket traffic using nftables as a drop-in replacement for the BPF (which originally designed in the nineties, it requires up to eight instructions to compare an IPv6 address). The result of this task is to deliver the patches to kernel mainstream that will provide this new userspace feature. This should also open some debate on the providing support to use nftables at other points of the networking stack such as ingress (for policing) and egress (for shaping). Nftables will come with powerful userspace libraries, allowing third party userspace applications. The project will support distribution of rulesets over the network. This can facilitate the distribution of rulesets from one centralized unique point, which should help to make it easier for system administrators to maintain multiple firewalls. It should also be useful in a classical primary-backup high-availability setup. The architecture may also serve as a repository to distribute rule-set feeds that from some authority that you decide to trust. The initial version should already provide a basic infrastructure and features for the rule-set distribution software using one centralized point for rule-set distribution. One key feature to motivate users to migrate to nftables is to provide a simple utility that translates their rule-sets to nftables. We already have a compatibility layer that uses a kernel extension denominated 'nft_compat' which allows you to use all existing {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables target and matches from the nftables framework. However, the main problem with the current approach is that there is no real rule-set translation, instead we are re-using part of the existing x_tables kernel infrastructure.

{"url":"/project/nat64/","title":"nat64","description":"nat64 [Open source IPv4-IPv6 translation gateway -- concluded on 2010/02/01] IPv4 and IPv6 networks are incompatible. The IETF recommendation has usually been to rely on dual-stack deployment: have both networks coexist until IPv6 takes over Ipv4. However, IPv6 growth has been much slower than anticipated. Therefore, new IPv6-only deployments face an interesting challenge communicating with the predominantly IPv4-only rest of the world. A similar problem is encountered when legacy IPv4-only devices will need to reach the IPv6 Internet. This project is about implementing an open-source NAT64 gateway to run on open-source operating systems such as Linux and BSD. The NAT64 Open Source implementation would benefit the engineering of the solution as well as providing initial implementation feedback. Moreover, an Open Source implementation will become the reference for the whole community, such as end users, network administrators, and protocol designers. Users will finally be able to deploy IPv6 connectivity without fear of being cut off from the rest of the Internet. In many situations, dual-stack deployment is not possible. For these cases, a gateway such as the proposed one is needed. It will enable completely new deployments, and users will automatically benefit. Moreover, an Open Source implementation will empower users by giving them access to the source code and letting them customize the gateway to accommodate new scenarios. The implementation will target both Linux and BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD). It will be portable to other POSIX systems. DNS ALG functionality will be added to Bind and Unbound. A patch will be produced and submitted to the Bind project and to the Unbound project for inclusion in their main distributions. IPv4/IPv6 translation functionality will be added to the Linux and BSD kernels."},
{"url":"/project/mujingle/","description":"MU-Jingle [Multi-User Jingle -- concluded on 2009/06/01] When a meeting between a scattered group of people needs to take place, a phone conference is a popular solution, especially in a business context. These calls can become costly especially when participants have to make long distance or international calls to participate. With the advent of cheap and abundant Internet connectivity, there is an opportunity to lower costs by transmitting call data over Internet connections. Additionally, the increasing ubiquity of webcams allows video as well as audio to be transmitted. The proprietary Skype service has become very popular for this purpose. Jabber's extension for audio/video conferencing is limited to communications between two users. Extending Jabber further to support multi-party audio/video conferences will allow it to match the functionality of proprietary offerings, whilst still providing all the benefits of XMPP. It is intended that Multi-User Jingle improves over three existing solutions: Jingle: by supporting more than two participants. Skype: by being an open standard with a free software implementation. SIP: by supporting reliable peer-to-peer connectivity, as opposed to requiring dedicated media relay infrastructure, thereby allowing a video stream from each participant without the need for multiplexing. In general, by adding support for multi-user audio/video to XMPP, users do not have to give up the benefits of XMPP in order to make a multi-user call. Deliverables A prototype client, using a Jabber-based protocol to negotiate an audio conference between at least three people.

Ksplice Ltd has started providing rebootless OS updates to more than 10,000 users of Ubuntu -a significant step, but larger-scale deployment is needed in order for the technology to become truly mainstream. The goals of this project are: to freely provide rebootless OS updates to 100,000+ users running the major community Linux distributions, and to get the Ksplice kernel software merged into the mainstream Linux kernel. The NLnet support is used for the development required to get Ksplice tool merged into the mainstream Linux kernel and the development work on the Uptrack application required to freely bring rebootless updates to Fedora, the second most popular desktop Linux distribution behind Ubuntu. These initiatives are critical to the path of taking this open innovation to mainstream adoption. Specifically, getting Ksplice merged into the mainstream Linux kernel is the best way to ensure that Ksplice has the full support of the diverse Linux kernel community. This support will improve Ksplice’s technical quality and encourage more people to trust and use Ksplice. Bringing Ksplice beyond Ubuntu is necessary since so many Linux users use distributions other than Ubuntu.

{"url":"/project/koruza/","title":"Koruza","description":"Koruza [Koruza -- concluded on 2015/03/01] KORUZA is an innovative open-source open-hardware wireless communication system, employing a new low-cost approach to designing free-space optical network systems, enabling building-to-building connectivity with a highly collimated light beam at a capacity of 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps) at distances up to 100 m. It is designed to be suitable for home as well as professional users, enabling organic bottom-up growth of networks by eliminating the need for wired fiber connections and associated high installation costs. The simplicity of use, low-cost and compact size allow the system to be deployed in any network. The project's own website Fast and low-cost Internet access is one of the primary goals of this time. Prompt deployment of information networks in any environment is key to bridging the digital divide, as well as boosting the economic development. \" The Digital Agenda for Europe 2020 \" aims to enable intermediate broadband access (100 Mbps) for at least half of Europe's households, at this time available just for a few due to very high infrastructure costs. Cost-effective, advanced and immediately available access technologies are needed to empower the world to construct the digital future. How does it work? KORUZA system connects two locations with a clear line of sight up to 100 m apart by placing a unit on either side. Infrared light of low power enables the connectivity at 1 Gbps while remaining eye-safe (Class 1). The system has sufficient capacity to be used for multi-user daisy-chain wireless connections. With the annual connection reliability greater than 99%, that can be increased further by adding a slower redundant Wi-Fi connection, KORUZA is suitable for branching out the high-capacity of a limited number of fiber access networks to a much wider population. The vast majority of existing free-space communication systems is designed for enterprise, carrier or military use, unsuitable for wider population. For whom? KORUZA is an open-source open-hardware ultrafast networking technology, innovating use of free-space optical networks by using mass produced electro-optical modules and combining them with 3D printing technology, simplifying the overall design. It is suitable for deployment in all situations - from home networks, community wireless networks to service providers. It is primarily designed for urban environments, where Wi-Fi networks suffer from spectrum congestion, disturbing each other and limiting their capacity and reliability. KORUZA is resilient to these problems as its light beam is highly collimated, thus numerous units can coexist in a dense urban area, where the demand for capacity is high and distances are relatively short. It is being developed to be a small and simple unit that can be mounted on a wall, window shelf or a pole, even by untrained professionals without specialized tools. Home users can thus simply establish the connection with a neighbour who has a fiber broadband connection. Community wireless networks can use the system to boost their wireless backbone capacity. Internet service providers can employ it for last-mile access and inter-user connectivity. Development KORUZA is based on our previous work, a bachelor research project by Luka Mustafa: Very Affordable Laser Ethernet Transceiver, at University College London under supervision of Dr. Benn Thomsen. The results of the development and experimental observations are as well presented in a paper Reintroducing Free-Space Optical Technology to Community Wireless Networks on AMCIS2013 conference in Chicago, scientifically confirming the design approach of implementing modules primarily developed for wired optical networks in free-space optical systems, at a distance of 125 m with capacity 1 Gbps.

Moreover, you can use the same technology to share any relevant information (such as keys for protection of your email) to anyone. The project's own website Imagine receiving a phone call from a number you've never dealt with. Now imagine you can ask the internet to share information about the caller, even before you decide to answer the call. It could be the fire department telling you your house is on fire, the family lawyer about a sensitive matter or a company trying to sell you the final edition of the Encyclopia Brittanica. In each situation you might have different requirements and wishes. Imagine what that would mean to the efficiency with which you communicate with people if they can magically unlock any information to you they are willing to share, and vice versa - and for your device to be able to handle that automatically. That would mean you would send your location to the fire department, encrypt the call with the lawyer and have your phone tell the company selling the encyclopedia you are not interested. That means you can send a document to the person you are talking to without clamping the phone to your shoulder or typing their email address with one hand. It gets even prettier when you contact the remote directory through a hub of your own. Your hub could help you to attach personal notes to that particular caller. For example, the pizza your partner ordered last time and definitely doesn't ever want to eat again. Or an internal contact reference code. Or a picture of that person you took yourself. Your hub might even dig up letters or bills that you have sent to the caller. And if you enjoy your privacy, it could even store the Short Authentication String used during the previous ZRTP-enciphered call. Interestingly, the technology to do this already exists, and it is commonly used and rock-solid. Chances are that your mobile devices can use it with a simple app already -- an LDAP client is available for most desktops and smaller platforms.

{"url":"/project/bricophone/","description":"Bricophone [The Bricophone Project -- concluded on 2009/11/01] The Bricophone is a community-oriented mobile phone infrastructure in Open Source. It is a low cost, low energy, open hardware, open source project built for communities up to ten thousand people within regional distances. The characteristic of the Bricophone infrastructure is that it does not require any static infrastructure like relays, antennas, or digital data centers. This provides the opportunity for special uses in poor communities, mass rescueing in disastered areas, and cultural and social activities like festivals and other mass events. The project's own website Bricophone user's profiles populations and communities in areas where regular cellular phone infrastructure is not possible for economical, energetic, or environemental reasons: areas with a poor population, mountains, seas, desertic or humid areas, protected natural or archeological sites. populations and communities in areas where regular cellular phone infrastructures lack power or have been destroyed: war or natural catastrophes as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and cold or hot extremeties. communities in social or cultural mass meetings, lile festivals, protests, gatherings. The Bricophone is not a replacement for regular cellular infrastructures nor an open-source cellullar phone for regular mobile phone networks. Features The sole purpose of the Bricophone infrastructure is voice communication. It works with brand-new wireless sensor network technologies used in industrial equipement. The main caracteristics of these new sensors technologies are mesh-networking, low-cost, and very low power consumption. These three technical caracteristics are the key of the project's potentialities. Mesh networking is a technology where each point of the network can route information to any other point in the same connected network. The routing of the information is done automatically as in internet, by an automatic choice of the closest device without central control. The Very Low Cost of the specialized wireless chips of the Bricophone allow to equipate different devices, not only for building mobile bricophones, but also for routing devices to transfer the calls though longer distances. The compactness of the electronic components allow the creation of very small devices. The low cost and relative simplicity of the hardware allows DIY (Do It Yourself) possibility and further improvements by the Bricophone community, as we can see in the Arduino project. The Low Power Consumption allows the utilisation of solar, wind or muscular energy, or very long period powering. Low energy powered bricophone routers can run month or years without maintenance, even in harsh environnements. Project setup In Spring 2007, the first basic voice-over-wireless tests with sensor technologies were executed. In September 2007, the first workshop took place in Brussles. In November, a workshop took place in Brazil. The next steps programmed by the leading team for the coming months: A multi-lingual website replacing the first existing pages Communication tools for community works: wiki, code repository, forum, mailing list Prototyping workshops in hardware, software and community tools in Paris (F), Brussles (B), Amsterdam (NL), Sheffield (UK), Barcelona (E) during 2008. Communication and partnership: Artfactories network, (a platform of international resources for creative centres) and Bricolabs network are participants of the project and will disseminate the knowledge through their networks. Dissemination workshops The first planned DIY fabrication and dissemination workshop will be helt in Dakar, Senegal, in the Ker Thiossane Art Center, during the Pixelache 2009 festival. More dissemination workshops will follow in the different continents, at the initiative of local community members.

{"url":"/people/TedLindgreen/","description":"Ted Lindgreen Dr. Ted Lindgreen (1948) is a Dutch internet pioneer and innovator that perhaps more than any other person can be seen as the landscape architect of the early European internet. He transitioned the pioneering EUnet network from its embryonic state to a full-blown European internet infrastructure, as volunteer and later as the first managing director of NLnet foundation. After a PhD in experimental physics at Groningen, dr. Lindgreen had moved to Amsterdam to work for NIKHEF, the Netherlands Institute for Subatomic Physics. NIKHEF operated the worlds largest linear particle accelerator at the time, which meant that (like its modern day successor CERN) it needed the absolute cutting edge technology to operate. Together with Jaap Akkerhuis at CWI, dr. Lindgreen devised and set up a fiber optic network at the science campus on which they were able to run TCP/IP - one of the first such networks anywhere in the world. The network was a key part of the EUnet infrastructure. In order to avoid legal issues, NLnet first operated a closed 'members only' network, and later incorporated as a not-for-profit foundation, until a change in telecom laws allowed it greater freedom. In 1987, CWI decided they wanted to hand over management of the fibre network to another party and asked the NLUUG (the Netherlands Unix User Group) whether they could take care of this. Dr. Lindgreen was a board member, had the required experience and volunteered. When he became Managing Director of NLnet foundation in 1991, Dr. Lindgreen brought a unique combination of technical and business skills along, as well as the eagerness to make the best of these exciting new developments. At the time from an operational point of view NLnet was little more than a handful of volunteers running contributed hardware. In order to scale up, Lindgreen invested his personal life savings until that point to buy NLnet its first router from Cisco for 35.000 guilders. Lindgreen deserves the (probably globally unique) credit as the mastermind, financial backer and engineer behind succesfully breaking a country-wide monopoly which was the legal priviledge of telecom operator PTT - a the time still part of the national government. Unlike its wealthy counterpart, NLnet was a grass-roots operation without access to any subsidies or other public funding whatsoever - yet it was at the international front of technology. Lindgreen investigated and talked to many potential providers that had some form of internal network, from e.g. banking, energy companies and even technology company Philips. Ultimately he found a partner in the Dutch rail company, Nederlandse Spoorwegen. NLnet impressed the managemement of the rail company, by making several working dialup connections across the country ( VPRO in Hilversum, Knoware in Utrecht and IAF in Groningen). The modems used were low-cost devices crafted especially for NLnet, modelled after the original design created by Jaap Akkerhuis. His work ethos - working seven days a week, making long hours - and the willingness and ability to do hands-on technical work, were the kernel of huge growth for NLnet. The versatile Lindgreen placed many of the modem banks himself along the rail tracks throughout the country. He spent days crawling around the rail tracks debugging flaky connections, caused for instance by a different type of cable being used for particular parts of the trajectory - helped by his physics background and the technical expertise built up in his prior career. The deal with NS allowed NLnet to establish a superior network with full national coverage without interference or obstruction from the Netherlands PTT. Lindgreen's generous attitude of granting accesss to a generation of young internet service providers meant that end users had plenty of alternatives to choose from. NLnet's success firmly established the new business model of internet as an alternative to the traditional telecom infrastructure, and inspired many other","title":"Ted Lindgreen"},

Most people do not have a clue which digital threats and privacy infringements related to the (use of the) Internet exist, and which tools can help to reduce these. The open contest \"User Safety on the Internet Highway\" has the goal to identify a comprehensive collection of user-friendly software (if possible fitting on one CD/DVD or USB stick) allowing normal Internet users to protect themselves from various threats and privacy infringements in a simple and pragmatic way whereever they go. Primary targets are users of Windows on the one hand and users of free operating systems (Linux/*BSD) on the other. Of course the inherent security issues with e.g. Microsoft Windows cannot be solved, but a number of other issues can be covered. What do we have in mind? A collection of software that makes it easy to contain risks and to use and/or (un)install software whereever you go in untrusted or even semi-hostile environments. This might take the form of a well-tuned and feature-rich distro and/or a collection of portable and/or installable applications. Preferably that would mean choosing the security level you want once and getting it by pressing the button). This means assisting to reach the current state of the art in protecting user's privacy, personal information and communication. Distribution We think (although we leave space for certain creativity), that the distro should include, but not be limited to: Crypto-tools (not too strong) and steganography tools; Anonimizer (search engine scrapers, traffic obfuscation and such); Anti-botnet, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, antivirus, other of that kind; Strong password generation; Secure password / certificate management; Secure disk / folder / file encryption tools; Standalone secure backup and disk wiping software; Secure chat; Secure password management; Intrusion detection and network segmentation; Firewall In addition, a number of more common useful security tools and/or information on how to use them may be identified: Mail and browser extensions for GPG, S/MIME, cache monitoring and protection, IDN domain names, scripting execution prevention/white listing, one time mail aliases, iframe blocking, cookie management, user agent renaming; Black holing lists (/etc/hosts, Windows HOSTS file) for OS level blocking of malware; Sand box environments for browsers and other risk factors; Secure serverless file sharing (direct as well as anonymous P2P/F2F); Secure port knocking; Scanning software for known (wireless) network exploits e.g. default passwords on routers; SSH/SCP/SFTP clients and servers; Secure VoIP; A list of public DNS-es to be able to avoid ISP DNS; Privacy testing suite; Network traffic analysis and forensics; Packet spoofing; Possibilities for free digital certificates and other identity management tools. In order to keep a balance between defence possibilities and managing complexity for the layman, so at present we do not think it is necessary to go into a too comprehensive threat model (say, protection against electromagnetic eavesdropping may be a step too far, for instance). Then again, that is up to you. Awareness One of the main goals is not only to provide tools protecting normal user, but also create awareness and let him or her be acquainted with these tools and with the necessity to protect from digital threats. It is therefore necesary that the compilation shall contain: Short and easy explanation of vulnerabilities, threats and privacy infringements related to utilisation of computer and the Internet. Explanation of the fact that the digital defence is more the matter of mind-set than that of technology. Maybe a couple of understandable articles from respectable journals / papers for a user willing to dig into the matter. How the Results are going to be used?

This project and its outcome will provide the possibility for users of both universes to use either protocol to interoperate with each other for audio, instant messaging and presence. If the software is installed on the desktop next to an existing application it can encapsulate or tunnel conversations from one protocol to the other - serving as a wormhole between the two universes. It should work transparently with little or no configuration. It will allow users to share contacts and establish chat and audio sessions without having to bother of the protocol used to address buddies in user@domain format. If the software is used on a server, one should simply point the appropriate DNS record of a domain to the server, and any session request made with either SIP or XMPP protocol will be bridged to the other side.

The access nodes in Wisper are projected to be low cost (US$&nbsp;100) wifi boxes some Public Domain (fully self-configuring) networking software (probably on Linux and/or BSD OS's). Access and usage to the Wisper network should be free of charge. The plan is to create clouds of Wisper nodes. And then clouds of Wisper-clouds, expanding all over the globe. The Wisper idea is inspired by the in November 2005 initiative of the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project. Wisper could boost the OLPC target to provide internet access in development countries (and even in your neigbourhood). MIT research develops Roofnet a wireless infrastructure for the town of Cambridge, MA USA. The number of nodes (currently 37) is much smaller than the target for Wisper.

The introduction of the network stack cloning model enables the kernel to simultaneously maintain multiple independent and isolated network stack instances. Combined with forcible binding of user processes to individual network stacks, this concept can bring us a step closer to an efficient pseudo virtual machine functionality which opens new possibilities particularly in virtual hosting applications, as well as in other less obvious areas such as network simulation and advanced VPN provisioning.

The VDD gives users a possibility to enjoy their own favourite operating systems, including those that are not Open Source, possibly at the same time, simply by switching from one to another, on each single thin client, on demand, across a network. Thin clients are interfaces to proper and isolated machines, that can be made to measure for whatever need and in whatever number. This is completely transparent to users, who, even from an obsolete machine, can select a particular machine with certain characteristics and then do absolutely everything they would do on such a machine as if it was physical and with its virtual performance.

{"title":"Uberflow","url":"/project/uberflow/","description":"Uberflow [Uberflow -- till 2015/05/01] OpenFlow is a cornerstone and the de-facto standard protocol for software-defined networking (SDN). The API for manipulating the network state is currently being standardised by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) as NBI (which stands for 'North-Bound Interface'). As an emerging standard NBI has significant potential to create the ecosystem for network architectures. The project's own website OpenFlow is a simple protocol that allows switching hardware to be unbound from routing decisions. The intelligence is moved to a central controller that is responsible for multiple switches in a network. Through OpenFlow, the controller is dynamically notified of flow creations (as with NetFlow and IPFIX), and can respond with actions that are to be taken by switching hardware in the data path: route the flow elsewhere, change fields, etc. This dynamic altering of network state is what makes OpenFlow, and SDN in general, very attractive in a number of fields. The Open Networking Foundation is a consortium that has been created to take over the specification of the OpenFlow protocol as well as to extend it. One of the extensions being developed in the ONF is the north-bound interface (NBI). The NBI is situated between the control layer and the application layer. In a nutshell, the NBI is the API through which network operator applications manipulate the network state. The controller is in the middle of it all: it speaks with those applications through the NBI, and it speaks with the switching hardware through OpenFlow.

{"title":"Trusted Boot Module","description":"Trusted Boot Module [Trusted Boot Module ] This project is developing a system for booting trusted OS images on existing, ARM-based systems. It will consist of open hardware and software that allows users to start up Linux systems on off-the-shelf ARM development boards, where the system ensures that the system can be booted in a trusted state by booting only OS images trusted by the vendor and/or the user of the system. The hardware consists of cheap, off-the-shelf components that are simple to analyse and program, and which provide for an easily verifiable solution that does not depend on 'black box' components. This project brings trusted boot to the market of commodity ARM-based servers, thus providing the community a security solution that allows for, for example, affordable distributed hosting and computing. The goal of the project is simple: to provide a means to ensure that, at a specific point in time – specifically, after system (re)start – the state of a system is known and trusted. For non-centralized systems, being able to bring the system into a sane, known state is more difficult than in a centralized environment where the hardware is directly accessible to the system's maintainers. The TBM developed in this project allows maintainers of a distributed system that consists of (small) devices/servers located with (trusted) end-users to ensure that the state of the devices can be known. The system provides way to ensure that at system boot time, no untrusted code is executed. The aim of the trusted boot system is to protect against persistent backdoors that may be inserted by a remote attacker exploited a vulnerability, and made modifications to e.g., kernels stored on a device's disk. At runtime, we can only prevent such compromise by traditional means, but by rebooting the system at regular intervals we can at least ensure that if a system is compromised, this compromise is time limited and that integrity is restored eventually.

{"title":"Tor low-bandwidth","description":"Tor low-bandwidth [Tor for low-bandwidth users -- concluded on 2009/04/01] The Tor anonymity system is currently only usable by internet users with high-bandwidth connections. Upon start of a Tor client, a large file with all Tor server descriptions is being downloaded. This \"Tor Directory\" file enables the client to pick from the available mix-servers in the Tor network. This Directory file is too large for users on modem lines or on mobile data networks (like GPRS) as it gets downloaded each time a user logs in, taking 10 to 30 minutes over a slow connection. Therefore, Tor is not usable by modem and mobile users. One of the major goals of the Tor project is to provide secure anonymous internet access to users in repressive states. These location often have very slow internet connections to the outside world. By enabling these users to use the Tor network, significant progress can be made towards free communication and free information in these countries. An evolution of the Tor protocol is proposed to reduce the initial download size. The new Tor protocol version should change the way a client receives the information for its Tor circuit setup in such a way, that the initial download can be performed over a slow modem line in less then three minutes. The work to be conducted under the proposal is split into two major deliverables, with the end goal of having the protocol change production ready and propagated to the Tor users within a timeframe of less then 8 months.

Despite its importance, use of SPIs has not proliferated because it is highly complicated to develop and maintain. A novel approach based on a W3C specification is proposed: SMIL Timesheets.

{"title":"Swirl","url":"/project/swirl/","description":"Swirl [PPSPP implementation in Erlang/Swirl -- till 2014/12/01] Current peer-to-peer traffic on the internet happens in a wide variety of often application-dependent protocols, limiting growth and innovation. A working group of the IETF has in recent years been developing the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) to establish a safe, modern standard in this area. NLnet considers a mature standard for P2P applications an important building block for the future of the internet. Swirl is an open source reference implementation of the PPSPP proposed standard in the Erlang programming language. The Swirl project is led by Dave Cottlehuber (Austria). The project's own website Tomorrow's internet will bear little resemblance to that of today. The protocols we use today are not suited to scale and handle the growth of video traffic, changing connectivity types and the rise of mobile devices, and the shift towards Peer-to-Peer traffic. This project aims to provide and promote a working solution to these problems, by implementing the IETF draft Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol, aka PPSPP. \"Allow anybody, anywhere, to share or live stream their content, in the small or at scale, securely and efficiently, from any device, without being dependent on centralised storage or services, using a free &amp; open protocol\". Mobile devices are now the primary means of accessing the internet, and peer-to-peer protocols like BitTorrent are taking over from HTTP for shifting and sharing data, driven by the explosion in video, high-resolution images and audio, even as global internet usage continues to grow. Globally, mobile data traffic will increase 13-fold between 2012 and 2017. Mobile data traffic will grow at a CAGR of 66 percent between 2012 and 2017, reaching 11.2 exabytes per month by 2017. Global mobile data traffic will grow three times faster than fixed IP traffic from 2012 to 2017. Global mobile data traffic was 2 percent of total IP traffic in 2012, and will be 9 percent of total IP traffic in 2017. -- Global Consumer Internet Traffic, 2012-2017, Cisco. Peer-to-peer traffic has grown enormously in recent years, consuming 1/2 to 3/4 of all internet traffic depending on the exact survey referred to. Today's reliable and stable connection from a single location at home or work, is being replaced by temporary and irregular connections through different providers and connections, as users roam over VPN, public wifi, and home wifi via broadband, on GSM and LTE cellular networks. Internet video streaming and downloads are beginning to take a larger share of bandwidth and will grow to more than 69 percent of all consumer Internet traffic in 2017 -- Global Consumer Internet Traffic, 2012-2017, Cisco. The primary type of traffic on the internet (by volume) is now video media, with YouTube, Netflix and similar services representing more than half of all traffic in most regions. The growth in video content has been so significant that it has pushed the proportion of peer-to-peer data consumption down even though both have risen significantly in total volume. In North America's broadband usage, video content was already 68% of all downstream traffic, comprising 17% YouTube and 32% Netflix. HTTP by comparison is 11% only. Peer-to-peer traffic comprises a staggering 40% upstream traffic, and a much lower 6% downstream. Similar trends are present across the globe. Commonly-used protocols such as TCP and HTTP suffer from slow startup times before content arrives, unnecessary metadata and are not ideally fitted to streaming data volumes in near or real-time, to multiple endpoints, and many existing proprietary P2P protocols have typically focused on static file sharing, needing enhancements to enable live streaming support. From the carrier or operator perspective, every proprietary solution requires custom integration into their network, including traffic shaping, billing, and caching technologies.

{"title":"SnabbWall","description":"SnabbWall [SnabbWall -- till 2017/03/01] Layer-7 firewalls, or application firewalls, empower technical users and administrators near the endpoints of networks. They can provide one centralized, flexible tool to subsume many other ones, simultaneously reducing the burden to learn how to achieve certain ends, and freeing people from the confines of very specific tools. Software Defined Networking has been revolutionizing the network space over the last couple of years. SDN uses commodity hardware to implement network elements and functionalities which were generally provided by very expensive, and usually inflexible, special-purpose network appliances. SnabbWall is designed as a modular, application-level (Layer-7) firewall suite built on the foundations of the popular open source SDN Snabb Switch, allowing it to be used with cheap commodity hardware. As an application-level (Layer-7) firewall, it will be able to: Inspect network traffic and detect flows of related data, and pinpoint which application has produced a certain data flow. Filter (drop, reject, or accept) packets using criteria specified in a set of rules, which can use the information inferred by inspecting the packets. As a suite, it will include a complete firewall program out of the box. As a modular system, it will provide a set of components which can be reused in other Snabb Switch designs. The project's own website The L7 Spy application will be capable of identifying protocol data flows (that is, it will work in at the application level, or Layer-7) but other than that packets just flow through it. The idea here is that sometimes it is interesting to just know which kind of traffic passes through a network, for example to gather statistics. If a packet is determined to belong to a certain protocol, ancillary metadata is attached to the packet. The way metadata is handled does not ever modify the packet itself, so applications which are not designed to handle it do not need to be modified. On the other hand, the L7 Firewall application will implement the actual logic of matching packets against a set of rules which determine what to do with each one of them. What is special about this application is that, on top of what other filtering solutions like pflua may offer, it also allows to match the additional metadata generated by L7 Spy — if present. Note that it is not at all necessary to use both applications in tandem: they can function independently, to allow others to mix-and-match them as desired. Yet, they are designed to work together, and SnabbWall also provides a standalone program ( snabb wall ) which implements a complete application-level firewall.

RDF is actively used in a large number of projects and products, like Adobe's XMP, The FOAF project, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, and the Open Directory Project. Sesame is used in a growing number of these projects as an invisible database component, whenever RDF statements have to be stored and retrieved. Some examples of application: Bibster: a Java-based system which assists researchers in managing, searching, and sharing bibliographic metadata (e.g. from BibTeX files) in a peer-to-peer network, using Sesame and SeRQL to store and query.

Searsia enables existing sources to cooperate such that they together provide a search service that resembles today’s large search engines. In addition to using external services at will, you can also use it to integrate whatever private information from within your organisation - so your users or community can use a single search engine to serve their needs. The project's own website Searsia is an open source engine and a protocol, created by academic researchers. Using Searsia you can: Manage and share large collections of independent sources; Select for each query the most relevant sources; Combine sources in an aggregated search interface; Searsia learns over time what kind of information each source provides. To see it in action check the search engine of the University of Twente that combines the results of about 30 sources, including results from Google's web crawl, from Courses, from News, the Telephone directory, the Timetables, as well as results from social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Flickr.

{"title":"RPKI-RTRlib","url":"/project/rpki-rtrlib/","description":"RPKI-RTRlib [RPKI/RTRlib -- till 2017/03/01] The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a component of secure interdomain routing and has recently been standardized in the IETF SIDR group (RFCs 6810 / 6811 ). RPKI is currently being rolled out, and is a significant and necessary step towards fully protecting BGP. However, the mechanism does incur additional load at BGP routers. In order to reduce that load, RPKI objects can be fetched and cryptographically validated by cache servers. The RPKI/RTR protocol defines a standard mechanism to maintain the exchange of valid RPKI data between cache server and router. RTRlib is one of the two open source reference implementation of RTR, originally created by researchers from the Computer Systems & Telematics group at Freie Universität Berlin and reseachers from the INET research group at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, under the supervision of dr. Matthias Wählisch and Thomas Schmidt. The RTRlib is a real-time capable, open-source (MIT licensed) C library that implements the RPKI router part. Basically, it fetches data from an RPKI cache server and allows for prefix origin validation as well as initial steps of BGP path validation (draft 6810bis). The RTRlib can serve as the backend for BGP daemons and monitoring tools in real-world operations, as well as user guidance. The project's own website The project has a public mailing list and forum: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rtrlib rtrlib@googlegroups.com The RTRlib grants an easy and highly efficient access to cryptographically valid RPKI data without relying on a specific cache server or RPKI validator implementation. The RTRlib is useful for developers of routing software but also for network operators. Developers can integrate the RTRlib into BGP daemons to extend their implementation towards RPKI. Network operators may use the RTRlib to develop monitoring tools (e.g., to evaluate the performance of caches or to validate BGP data). Extensions like the RPKI browser plugin show prefix validation results to end users, allowing them to actually check for routing anomalies as they browse. The project will further advance and mature this software, and integrate and disseminate the solution - actively promoting its adoption by the wider internet community through e.g. a workshop held at IETF 95 in Berlin. link-lab"},

However, users are pretty much electronically naked in any OSN: (1) User’s data is in clear to the OSN service provider, and can be accessed by many other parties without any consent; (2) User’s activities are under surveillance by the OSN service provider. Numerous privacy breaches have been reported, often with disastrous consequences to the user concerned, such as getting fired by the employer, getting rejected from a job application, even leading to suicide. To mitigate the problem, most OSN service providers provide some privacy controls to users to protect their information. However, this is not the antidote and will never be, because the aforementioned problems (1) and (2) still remain. This project will design and implement a privacy-preserving communication protocol to mitigate the problems (1) and (2). In more detail, it will achieve the following features: A user always keeps his private data in encrypted form. Two users can match each other based on their respective private data sets, without revealing anything. Two friends who share some common private date, communicate in private. The communication will remain private against the OSN service provider and other users. The implementation will be based on the OpenSocial API, and programmed in javascript.

LogReport aims to change this. These files contain the traces of computer activity, and by intelligently analyzing these traces, one can increase existing system efficiency and improve future system design. The LogReport project serves a dual purpose: developing and maintaining Lire, an Open Source reporting and analysis software package, and serving as a nexus of documentation, ideas, and thoughts on the topic of log files and their potential applications. There are quite a few specific tools for analyzing particular types of log files. However, LogReport's Lire is designed as a generic tool, with plug-in capability for handling a wealth of different types of log files and report integration features.

Ksplice makes it possible for system administrators and end-users to perform OS updates effortlessly, without a reboot. This project will make an open source Linux distribution be the first operating system in the world that does not require regular reboots for security updates. This technology also has the potential to significantly hinder network attackers by reducing the window of vulnerability during which computer systems are running software with known problems.

{"title":"Jitsi-DNSSEC","url":"/project/jitsi2/","description":"Jitsi-DNSSEC [DNSSEC for Jitsi -- concluded on 2012/03] Jitsi (formerly known as SIP Communicator), is a Java based open source VoIP and Instant Messaging client supporting various protocols such as SIP and XMPP. Trying to not being just another SIP Client it incorporates security mechanisms like ZRTP for encrypted media streams (audio, video, desktop sharing, etc.) and OTR for instant messages. While these technologies provide a high level of security for the user data, the signaling metadata is blindly sent to the servers returned from DNS a query. Securing the connection to the server through TLS helps, but the connection can still be compromised when a rogue certificate can be obtained (for example from a government CA). At first sight signaling data seems not important, but looking at the newest developments in the Far East and North African countries it implies that some unfriendly people might only be interested in the metadata. DNS is responsible for converting names into network addresses to locate servers. Users usually receive the addresses of DNS servers from their internet provider. As conventional DNS provides no security mechanisms, a rogue DNS can very easily supply the user with faked responses to requests and therefore redirecting him to an arbitrary server. Jitsi, or any other client application, relies on the replies from the DNS servers. When a VoIP account is configured to use a specific server, it passes all traffic to the address obtained from the possibly rogue DNS server. Transporting the metadata over TLS to the server does not really solve the problem as some governments run certification authorities that are trusted by the operating systems and web browsers. A malicious server would therefore silently be able to listen to all metadata traffic. This is where DNSSEC comes into play. DNSSEC can guarantee the integrity and authenticity of replies. A DNSSEC aware client can be sure that a validated response is the one intended by the owner of the requested domain name. This avoids nearly all situations where a server tries to redirect the client to a malicious server. The project will add client side DNSSEC validation and certificate checking to Jitsi, thus making end-to-end SIP communication secure.

{"title":"Jingle Nodes","url":"/project/jingle-nodes/","description":"Jingle Nodes [Jingle relay nodes -- concluded on ] One of the main goals of the first version of the Jingle Protocol was to create a P2P enabled protocol, depending on XMPP for routing but at the same time able to negotiate sessions and exchange content without main proxy servers. After 5 years we still don't have implementations which supported the current specifications in full. SIP on the other hand, is not very efficient and simple to use for P2P connections, but is widely deployed. It is much simpler to install and, although with higher costs, does provide media connectivity. \"Jingle Nodes\" simplifies the erection of (public) relays, It also makes every buddy in your contact list a potential Node. An additional positive aspect is that a client does not need to run its own Relay Node, but only configure its \"usage specification\" (no more than two or three pages), as the application runs on the server side.

{"title":"Identity, Privacy &amp; Presence","description":"Identity, Privacy &amp; Presence \"Privacy is not a crime\" The right to confidentiality is part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is also one of the basic premises for a free and open society. In recent years we have seen a digital divide of privacy emerge. Governments and the private sector are arming themselves with privacy enhancing technologies using overlay networks and cryptography, sometimes even creating their own separate infrastructures for private communication. They are driven to do this by the increasing privacy threats of modern communication: tracking and tracing, data retention, uncontrollable 'lawful intercept' and data harvesting. The less financially endowed are left without much protection. The banner of the 'war on terror' has been misused to alter the fabric of the societies it claims to protect, in many cases almost beyond recognition. A technology push has resulted in the burden of proof principle subtly but undeniably being inverted. More and more citizens are unwillingly and unknowingly the subject of investigation without being concretely suspected. Possible relieving facts are kept out of their view, and in most cases they have no access to information collected about them, denying their right of self-defence. The end-to-end principle of the internet and its international character allows for technological measures that can restore some of the privacy and sovereignty of the more vulnerable nation states that has been taken away by interception of communication, tracking, tracing, logging and data warehousing. There is also a window of opportunity: at this moment several billion dollar industries clash as tectonic plates against each other around real-time communication. All forms of voice communication and video conferencing are moving over to the internet in one way or the other. On the other hand there is a definite convergence of instant messaging and online collaboration technologies towards using interoperable standards. This is all about the presence of the same user. It is our goal to ultimately have all presence related services consolidated into strong and robust standards that guarantee interoperability and --by design-- protect privacy. Another aspect of confidentiality is private data of all kinds. The data concerning everything and everyone is now not only available to government institutions, but is being more and more collected and (mis)used by commercial entities. In these cases citizens can impossibly control the information. All kind of data --location data of mobile operators, videocameras on highways, in streets and shops, credit card and payment chip data, easy location tracability due to RFID chips in your clothes, emails and browsing behaviour-- are being collected both by the government and by private organisations and are coupled to each other to produce a complete track of a person. Thus, a transparent picture of the whole private life of the citizen is created and utilized for often not clear purposes. \"Privacy must not be a luxury, and everyone should be able to afford it.\" We believe in safe, trustworthy and robust real-time presence and session technology as an enabler for privacy. The foundation will focus on technology development as well as creating awareness, and will be actively pursuing the further enhancement of online privacy and standardisation in internet based communication and presence tools.

One of the main problems of OpenSimulator is that it's too technical for people who want to perform basic operations within this virtual world platform. Compared to the existing or being developed tools like wiredux, gridmix, unga, the HWIOS tool has decentralized service management through osservices (sideproject of hwios), it's page-refresh-less (preperation for gwave kind functionality), it's very liberally licensed (bsd license), it has tms map support through osmaps (sideproject of hwios), and it's well structured. The hybrid web interface communicates directly with OpenSimulator server, and is thus able to hide the most of the complexity of admin tasks, and therefor makes most admin tasks easier for less technically oriented user. Besides administrative tasks like user-, service- and land-management, HWIOS is meant to become a general-use next-gen webportal with virtual world support. The whole web application doesn't use page refreshing (html over json transport), and is strongly focussed on supporting html5 features, like collaborative text editing through web sockets. It is not concerned about backwards compatibility with older browsers, but will only support the most current html5 featured browsers (chromium and shortly Firefox).

Can one find evidence of specific MITM attacks in the form of publicly visible attack servers (that victims in the wild would have been redirected to via DNS or other mechanisms) or in the form of network-layer attacks detected against our own survey machines? Concrete evidence would be useful for motivating browser developers to adopt more secure trust models. How many domains intentionally use more than one apparently legitimate, apparently valid certificate at the same time? (This impacts on the design of enhancements to the TLS trust model) How many sites in the wild show different valid certificates to users who come from different parts of the Internet? How many CAs are used primarily or exclusively in particular countries or DNS domains? By Electronic Frontier Foundation .","url":"/project/https-obs/"},
{"title":"GoogleSharing","url":"/project/googlesharing/","description":"GoogleSharing [GoogleSharing -- concluded on 2011/02] GoogleSharing is a special kind of anonymizing proxy service, designed for a very specific threat. It ultimately aims to provide a level of anonymity that will prevent google from tracking your searches, movements, and what websites you visit. GoogleSharing is not a full proxy service designed to anonymize all your traffic, but rather something designed exclusively for your communication with Google. The system is totally transparent, with no special \"alternative\" websites to visit. Your normal work flow should be exactly the same. GoogleSharing is different from general anonymizing proxies: Most will mask your IP address, but not the identifying information in your HTTP headers. Google will still know who you are based on your Cookies, User Agent, etc. If the proxy does attempt to anonymize HTTP headers, they will do it by completely stripping cookies from your request. Google does not like this, and will tag you as a SPAM bot (how convient for them to do), which will force you to type in a CAPTCHA every time you issue a Google search, and will prevent you from issuing Maps requests at all. These types of proxies can be slow. It's not necessary to proxy all of your internet traffic if you're just trying to protect yourself from Google. Since GoogleSharing only proxies Google traffic, our bandwidth needs are much lower and thus our performance is much greater. GoogleSharing is different from Google replacements: GoogleSharing does not require that users change their workflow by visiting different websites. GoogleSharing supports all Google services which don't require a login, so it does more than just anonymize search. As Google continues to expand its grasp of the internet, GoogleSharing will automatically expand with it, automatically anonymizing whatever new services emerge in a fully transparent way. GoogleSharing has the potential to be fully distributed. As we make the move towards distributing requests across multiple configured servers, this is a definite step in the direction of P2P.

{"title":"GNUnet","url":"/project/gnunet/","description":"GNUnet [GNUnet -- concluded on 2009/12/31] GNUnet is GNU's framework for secure peer-to-peer networking. The framework is designed to support a range of applications. The primary application at this point is anonymous and censorship-resistant file-sharing. The main thrust of the proposed research is the design, implementation, deployment and evaluation of a secure, fully decentralized P2P routing protocol. Centralization increases operational costs, creating prominent targets for attacks and single points of failure as well as raising privacy concerns. The resulting network must be open, allowing new peers to join at any time. Adversaries are assumed to participate in the network, and the protocols must gracefully degrade in the presence of adversaries. Graceful degradation means that adversaries may only reduce the eciency of network operations, and that this reduction in eciency should be at most proportional to the resources available to the adversary. Our quest for practical protocols also implies that the design must handle real-world constraints. In particular, we want to handle connectivity issues that arise on the Internet (for example, due to firewalls). We use the term restricted-route networks to describe networks with restrictions limiting direct communications between participants. The proposed protocol also addresses the possibility of peers leaving the overlay network abruptly, joining and leaving the network frequently, and the fact that the amount of resources available to peers can differ by a few orders of magnitude. Our goal is to come up with adaptive protocols which adjust resource allocation based on automatically obtained network performance metrics that characterize the behavior of faulty or malicious nodes. Specifically, if an alternative path without faulty nodes exists, it must be possible for the routing algorithm to eventually discover it. The routing protocol must also be able to address disproportional consumption of resources. In particular, an adversary should not be able to issue a request that consumes more than a small constant factor of resources above the amount consumed by the normal operation of benign nodes. As a result, the proposed new protocol is able to prevent peers from launching asymmetric attacks, which leverage weaknesses in the system and magnify the damage caused. NLnet's contribution is used to pay a graduate student's salary for a full year (the university will waive tuition) to work on the implementation and evaluation of an improved routing algorithm for GNUnet. The routing algorithm will be implemented as a GNUnet service which means that many (existing and future) applications using the GNUnet framework will be able to take advantage of it. The specific proposed work is about a new routing algorithm that will support scalable and secure routing in a restricted-route topology. The project's own website"},

{"title":"DIFR-TSPM","description":"DIFR-TSPM [DIFR Tag-Scan-Privacy-Match -- concluded on 2009/06/01] Increasingly, products for sale in shops are being tagged by RFID tags. These tags contain a unique product or item number, which can be read out wirelessly over a short distance by an RFID reader. Their function in shops and supermarkets is similar to the ubiquitous paper barcode, except that RFID tags can also be read out if the tag is not in plain sight of the reader. This means these tags can also be read out surreptitiously when walking around the store, or afterwards when the items are in your shopping bag and you are walking on the street. This also holds true for payment cards and travel passes (e.g. the OV chipcard in the Netherlands) that people carry with them. This has raised concerns about the impact for RFID technology on the privacy in our society. The goal of the project is to develop a demonstrator of a different way to inform consumers about the RFID tags on the items they buy or the tags that surround them in their environment. Main idea is to use a mobile phone to display information about RFID tags in the vicinity. In particular, the setup of the demonstrator will operate as follows. A consumer sets his privacy preferences in a profile stored on his mobile phone. If he holds the phone close to a product in a shop containing an RFID tag, the phone will read the tag number from the tag. It will then query (over the Internet, either through GPRS, UMTS or WiFi) the backoffice to retrieve the privacy policy corresponding to the tag number. Then it will match the tag policy with the consumer policy, and present the result of the match to the consumer on the display of the mobile phone in an intuitive and appealing manner. This demonstrator will be used to show how such a concept: empowers users in deciding for themselves how their privacy is affected and how to respond to that information, and allows producers to efficiently communicate their privacy policy to consumers.

{"title":"Declarative web service security","description":"Declarative web service security [Declarative web service security in NixOS] This project aims to make NixOS the first computer operating system to package TLS Pool as a service component, and will allow to combine the power of declarative packaging with the unique security characteristics of TLS Pool to create a solid and versatile delivery channel for decentralised internet applications. The project's own website Creating secure webservices is non-trivial. Every application has its own security configuration mechanism, which means there is lots of room to make mistakes, neglect flaws and end up with vulnerable systems. TLS Pool is a ground-breaking mechanism from the ARPA2 project to isolate security processes and key material from actual applications themselves, and allows to manage transport layer security at a system level. NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages. It is used increasingly in complex environments where reproducible behaviour and configurability matter, from desktop systems to some of the top 500 supercomputers.

{"title":"ARPA2 Steamworks","url":"/project/steamworks/","description":"ARPA2 Steamworks [ARPA2 Steamworks] ARPA2 SteamWorks is a set of tools that co-operate to transmit more-or-less centrally controlled configuration settings over any network, and make these settings available to individual programs. Updates are passed around instantaneously when network connections are good, but the last version of the information can be used when the network temporarily degrades. The project is part of the ARPA2 project, which is engineering towards an overall architecture scalable to run a future internet that is secure by design. The project's own website Configuring and provisioning TLS &mdash; trusted (root) certificates, intermediates, end-user certificates, and public keys &mdash; can be a complicated business. The ARPA2 TLS Pool project makes it simpler for third-party applications (e.g. a web browser, or a web server) to use TLS and identity information. Configuration of TLS Pool itself however is still somewhat complicated: it provides a number of databases for configuring its behavior -- that is, the way it provides TLS and identity support to applications and the parameters of its outgoing TLS connections -- but filling those databases needs an API and a user interface. ARPA2 SteamWorks is about creating machinery for distributing configuration information through LDAP and using that for local provisioning through the Pulley (a local daemon) and Pulley Plug-ins (used to configure specific applications, e.g. TLS Pool). The configuration of the Pulley is done through a Pulley Script (which can, in turn, be distributed through LDAP). The Pulley Plug-in mechanism is generic and in the longer term will evolve more plug-ins for configuring other (sub)systems, e.g. writing ISC DHCPd configuration or Local Unbound configuration files. The project will make it possible to connect the complete configuration of TLS Pool to the SteamWorks machinery by building a SteamWorks Pulley Plug-In and Pulley Scripts that can fully configure TLS Pool. This includes defining all of the configuration elements for TLS Pool in LDAP schemata. SteamWorks also provides a framework for writing web-based front-ends to the LDAP configuration though the Crank component of SteamWorks. In order to provide the user interface for TLS Pool provisioning, we will construct that front-end (web application). This gives us a mechanism for filling the TLS Pool configuration in LDAP, distributing it to the Pulley through LDAP, and then locally turning it into configuration for provisioning TLS for applications. (An extension of this mechanism would involve generically associating Some parts of this system are already built as proofs-of-concept: there is a stub Pulley Plug-in for configuring the trusted root certificates in TLS Pool, as well as a rudimentary web-interface for filling those in in LDAP. This project aims to turn those proofs-of-concept into fully functional configuration tools.

Its application domain is information visualization, which is characterized by handling huge data sets with unkown correlations and by real-time zooming within multiple graphical and textual representations. TimeWalker is primarily intended to be a useful instrument for people like system-administrators that are confronted with unmanageable amounts of logging data. Most tools for analyzing log data start with filtering the data based on some assumptions about what is interesting in the data. TimeWalker attempts to visualize the complete unfiltered data with maximal information density and to exploit the pattern-recognition capabilities of the human end-user for discovering interesting patterns in the data.

{"description":"Stratosphere IPS [Stratoshere IPS -- till 2016/10/01] The Stratosphere IPS is a free software Intrusion Prevention System that uses Machine Learning to detect and block known malicious behaviors in the network traffic. The behaviors are learnt from highly verified malware and normal traffic connections in our research laboratory. Its goal is to provide the community and especially vulnerable targets with low budgets such as NGO's and civil society groups with an advanced tool that can protect against targeted attacks. The project's own website The Stratosphere IPS project was born in the CTU University of Prague in Czech Republic, as part of the PhD work of Sebastian García. The core of the Stratosphere IPS is a machine learning algorithm that analyzes individual network connections to extract their behavioral pattern. The patterns of known malicious connections are used to train the system and can subsequently be used to detect unknown traffic in new networks. The algorithms were publicly published and the behavioral models are continually being verified by academic researchers. Scanning your network is a very security and privacy sensitive matter. Because Stratosphere is published as a free software product, you do not have to trust it - you get to inspect every aspect of its inner workings and can freely improve upon it. It is already being used across the world - within multinationals, NGO's and academia. The design goal of the Stratosphere IPS is to develop a highly advanced and free network-based malicious actions detector that can help protect individuals, middle-size organizations, NGOs and almost any type of network.

{"description":"SPEAR [SPEAR -- concluded on 2012/03] SPEAR is a pilot experiment with the community, studying privacy and mobility aspects of P2PSIP. Peer-to-peer protocols increasingly appear in commercial data distribution and communication applications. Although several proprietary solutions are highly successful, an open standardized architecture for secure P2P services is only emerging. Many open issues need to be addressed, including peer lookup, scalability and resilience, NAT traversal, interoperating IPv4 and IPv6 peers, and performance on lightweight devices. The project on Secure Peer-to-peer Services Overlay Architecture of the Helsinki Institute for Information Technologies ( HIIT ) attempts to develop a generic mechanism to support such distributed services as P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP). In contrast to other approaches, security is taken as the corner stone of design, integrating support for Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Based Overlay Networking Environment (HIP-BONE) into the architecture. The architecture can support various P2P services, not limited to P2PSIP, such as P2P HTTP. We envision that P2P HTTP can be used to create a community version of many useful scenarios as plenty of current applications are based on HTTP. The work is carried out jointly with industrial partners actively involved in developing protocol specifications in the IETF. In particular, the design of a protocol stack combing overlay peer protocol with HIP and IPsec, binding peer identities to host identities, hierarchical P2P systems, and prevention of unwanted traffic are in scope of the project. An existing proof-of-concept demonstration of P2PSIP proxy will be further developed and tested with real users, and its usability will be evaluated.","title":"SPEAR","url":"/project/spear/"},

{"description":"SIPcollab [SIPcollab -- concluded on 2015/05/01] Collaborative editing on documents is required (or at least very helpful) in a broad range of use-cases. Collaborative editing capabilities between peers gets rid of the need of server and enables usage in places and circumstances where it was not possible before. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in combination with ZRTP and OTR offers encrypted multimedia (or \"whatever-media\") communication channels between individuals and groups. Common usages include voice and video conferencing, instant messaging (MSRP) and desktop sharing. While the latter technically allows people to present and share documents, it is brittle, bandwidth heavy and broadcast only - meaning that only a single user can edit a document. In order to provide more agile and interactive capabilities, the project adds collaboration facilities based on the collaborative webODF editor and the SIP/SIMPLE client SDK. Multiple users will be able to view and edit a document (such as a presentation or text document) with a group of people in parallel.

It also explains the process of syntactic analysis slightly differently than usual, which has helped me tremendously to \"understand parsing\". At the heart of the system is a computer program that converts a formal grammar (the IETF standard \"ABNF\" is used as input for testing, but it is easy to support W3C's \"EBNF\" format and similar formats thanks to this system) into a graph and additionally computes all possible traversals of this graph. The result is stored in a simple JSON-based data format. The project's own website Parselov is intended for software developers and protocol and data format designers.

{"description":"Open Document Format \"A disruptive technology in disguise\" The standardisation of the Open Document Format (ISO 26300:2006) took five years of hard work within OASIS. In 2006 the unanimous approval of this XML-based universal Office-format within the International Standards Organisation ISO meant a clear slope change point for innovation and market reach of open standards and open source in general. Governments, companies and individuals quickly recognised the enormous importance of having a way of encoding information that is truly portable across applications, operating systems and vendors as well as not having any problems crossing the barriers of time. ODF spawned a collective move away from company-dictated file formats that can only be adequately opened by a single application from a single vendor. We now understand that we want open standards that are oblivious with respect to the software used to generate or edit them. Good formats like ODF make global interoperability and the free flow of information a reality, which is a real breakthrough for the entire ICT world. The huge amount of active support ODF received from the ICT industry itself --and from society at large too-- is a testimony to that fact. Society doesn't change overnight, although the pace is astounding. In the past twenty years the lack of a mature open standard for information exchange at the document level has caused a very unhealthy de facto monoculture with fallout well beyond the operating system and productivity software where things started. These negative consequences move far beyond the economic realm and range from an increased digital divide and innovation poverty to large-scale cyber criminality and botnets such as Storm that are able to almost push countries off the internet. A self-imposed social acceptance of closed formats is sometimes difficult to break through, but with the dominant binary formats of the past being deprecated by their vendors themselves the situation looks very bright. The market has learned from the past, and with the file format decoupled from the applications there is no learning curve, a low cost of switching and most of all: an open market for innovation. And that is what we are seeing: great innovations taking place because people can move into the containers they were locked out for decades. Open Document Format is vendor independent and it's proven technology. It starts at no cost with full functionality and fidelity. And there are no hidden tricks, no opportunities for sabotage of inconvenient competitors. Because many of the leading players in the ODF arena (such as IBM Lotus Symphony, OpenOffice, KOffice, Abiword, the various plugins for Microsoft Word) are open source applications, there is 'full disclosure' and a very efficient 'best of breed' model built around ODF. NLnet foundation sees ODF as a key technology for the future of our society, which is why we plan to significantly fund a number of efforts in the area of ODF.

The project is financially supported by a grant from the Netherlands based not-for-profit investor NLNet Foundation. Netherlands government launches ODF service at Italian Plugfest: interoperability effort makes market more transparent The announcement took place during the second ODF plugfest, which brought together vendors and open source projects like IBM, Google, KOffice, Microsoft, Novell and OpenOffice.org. \"In a mature market a user should be able to compare the various suppliers transparently.\" says Bert Bakker, president of the OpenDoc Society. \"Officeshots.org ensures that you can see who delivers the best support for document exchange standards\" The service is available in a number of languages, including English, French, German, Chinese and Dutch. Users can submit a document, and can see what the output is of the various applications on the market.

{"description":"odfsvn [maintain ODF documents with SVN -- concluded on 2009/06/01] ODFSVN is a toolset to store ODF documents in a subversion repository. Why you would want to use subversion for documents: it allows you to use all features of a version control system: all changes are archived along with change notes, roll back to previous versions, see who made what changes and why, etc. people share their changes on the document through a shared repository. You can always see all changes from all editors, update your version to the latest revision and submit your changes. ODFSVN stores all repository information in the ODF metadata, you do not need to configure anything on your system. To illustrate how this works lets examine the differences between using odfsvn and email when working on a document with multiple people. Take Alex, Burt and Charles who are working on a proposal. Alex writes a first draft and mails that to Burt and Charles. Burt makes a few changes and mails the updated document to Alex and Charles. Finally a few hours later Charles finds two emails with documents in his mailbox. He needs to read both emails to see which one has the latest revision of the document, download the attachment and edit that. When he is done revising the document he, sends his updates back to Alex and Burt. As you see, this scenario involves a number of emails being exchanged at every step, people having to switch from their email application to their office application and back again for every revision, and no quick method to check if you have the latest revision of the document. Now lets see how Alice, Bernice and Charlene prepare a new marketing proposal using odfsvn. Alice creates a first draft and uses odfsvn to store it in a central subversion repository and mails it to Bernice and Charlene. Bernice is the first to respond and uses the document to download the latest version. When she is finished making changes, she uses odfsvn to commit her changes to the repository. When Charlene comes back in after lunch, she sees the email from Alice. She grabs the attachment, just like Bernice did earlier, uses odfsvn to update the document. odfsvn updates the document to the version Bernice commited earlier and Charlene can start editing. The second scenario is much simpler: there is no longer a need to exchange extra emails or for people to switch between their mail and office applications: odfsvn will always be able to update a document to the latest revision. In a future version, when odfsvn will also be available as a plugin for OpenOffice.org, this will be completely automatic. The project's own website","title":"odfsvn","url":"/project/odfsvn/"},
{"description":"ODF-KOffice [ODF support in KOffice -- concluded on 2009/10/01] KOffice has long had a strong OpenDocument implementation, the main implementation outside the famous OpenOffice. In KOffice version&nbsp;2, the text engine was upgraded to support more features and to support anonymous properties inside the text engine. This project aims to make KWord ready for release based on the new text engine. The new text engine requires that large parts of the existing ODF loading need to be reworked. The main task is therefore to make the ODF loading and saving code work as good (or even better) than with the latest stable release (1.6.3). To reach this goal, automated tests based will be created based on existing collection of ODF test-documents. The ODF-testsuite is available with an open licensing model, but is hardly used by any vendors. One reason for this is the amount of manual labor to load each test and visually confirm the on screen version is according to spec. The second problem is that the results are open to interpretation. The main project goal is to import relevant tests from the test-suite. This is estimated to contain around 100 tests. There will be a framework to load each test and code that tests if the loading succeeded and thus if the test passed. The second goal after this is to make a significant portion of the tests pass, which implies that KOffice can correctly load the ODF data. This goal includes implementing features in KWord that are required by ODF. The third goal, is that KWord as an application is finalized to be releasable at the KOffice 2.0.0 release.

{"description":"NoScript-Mob2 [NoScript Mobile part 2 -- concluded on 2011/11] NoScript is a popular GPL add-on for Firefox and other Mozilla Gecko-based browsers which considerably increases the web client security in several innovative and ground-breaking ways. Numerous useful features make NoScript the most advanced browser security tool, used and respected by most web security experts and serving as an example and an inspiration for safety enhancements which are slowly finding their way in mainstream web browser technologies. This project is the follow up of the first NoScript Mobile project, and will implement specific components: XSS Filter, ClearClick, Mobile-friendly Setup Interface, Remote Synchronization, ABE component (Application Boundaries Enforcer). The way people use the web is steadily moving towards mobility: we've got smart phones rivaling in power and usability with desktop PCs, and open source mobile OSes, like the Debian-derivative Maemo by Nokia or, even more prominently, Google's Android, which open exciting scenarios but also pose significant challenges. The challenge NoScript wants to accept and win is bringing the safest web browsing experience on the mobile platforms. In order to achieve this, NoScript will be re-designed and re-implemented to be compatible with the latest Firefox Mobile versions, which run both on Android and Maemo devices, trying to retain as much as possible of its core components and functionality.

{"description":"Nodewatcher [Nodewatcher -- concluded on 2015/05/01] Project aimed at creating a wireless network node management system that can be used to manage and update large amounts of nodes in wireless networks such as community networks. The project's own website The design and development of the nodewatcher platform comes from the needs and evolution of the wlan slovenija community wireless network. Its main idea is to automate as much as possible in building and operating a large wireless network. It encompasses functionalities sometimes named \"node database\", \"network dashboard\", \"network map\", but also a web-based firmware image generator, which allows easy generation of customized firmware images for each node individually. This technique improves efficiency significantly, and allows easy and failproof deployment of complex configurations even by people with no technical knowledge to do it otherwise. The idea is that once you register a new node and select target hardware, a customized firmware image for this node is generated, you just flash it, plug in and this is it. No additional configuration or web interface is needed. Because configuration is known, monitoring of the network can be done much better as it is known how each node should behave. If a node's hardware fails, you can just take new hardware (can be of different kind), flash it with same configuration, replace the node, and then later on analyze why previous hardware has failed. All this further lowers the workload, making maintenance easier and streamlined. Nodewatcher is not only solving the technical issues of running a mesh network efficiently, it is aimed at making a platform which supports the community and community spirit. The platform makes it transparent how the network operates, its health and how and who builds the network. For each volunteer, what and how much they contribute to the network, how important is their wireless node and how it is used. This feedback to the community is of vital importance and it has to be made in an intuitive and understandable, often non-technical, way, mostly through visualizations and designed graphical interface.

{"description":"Namecoin [Namecoin] Namecoin is a blockchain project that provides a decentralized naming system and trust anchor. Its flagship use-case is a decentralized top-level domain (TLD) which is the cornerstone of a domain name system that is resistant to hijacking and censorship. Among other things, this provides a decentralized trust anchor for Public Key Infrastructure that does not require third party trust. It operates independent from the DNSSEC root trust chain, and can thus offer additional security under some circumstances. The project's own website Without a PKI that is resistant to hijacking and censorship, the security guarantees of TLS are fundamentally incomplete. Namecoin is a very promising blockchain project that can, in principle, be used with any PKI or DNS-like naming system. By removing third-party trust from the TLS PKI, users are protected from man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and domain name seizures. Namecoin has some unique characteristics such as that Namecoin domain names can declare their TLS fingerprints directly &mdash without having to trust a certificate authority, notaries, or the regular DNS infrastructure. Namecoin can make anonymity networks significantly more usable by giving them a human-readable domain name, such as wikileaks.bit instead of kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion. In addition to the TLS PKI and anonymity networks, Namecoin can provide usable, trustless, and censorship-resistant alternatives to a range of critical security infrastructure, such as: PGP fingerprints for email and software signing. OTR fingerprints for XMPP. Usernames for the Ricochet Tor-based chat software. TLS client certificates for passwordless login to websites.

{"description":"Mailman-SSLS [Mailman Secure List Server -- concluded on 2009/04/01] Currently, there is no re-encrypting mailing list manager with support for both PGP and S/MIME. Mailman is the most popular Open Source mailing list manager. The Secure List Server project \"mailman-pgp-smime\" aims to include OpenPGP and S/MIME support in Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager. Adding re-encryption will enable groups of people to cooperate and communicate securely via email: mail can get distributed encrypted to a group of people, while the burden of managing individual keys is dealt with by the list software, not the sender. Furthermore, authentication is possible: the list server software takes care of checking this. This way, strong security for groups of people gets available for a wide audience. Technical specification This project will publish a patch for the official Mailman distribution. This patch handles both RFC 2633 (S/MIME) and RFC 2440 (OpenPGP) email messages. A post will be distributed only if the PGP (or S/MIME) signature on the post is from one of the list members. For sending encrypted email, a list member encrypts with the public key of the list. The mailing list server will decrypted the posting and re-encrypted it with the public keys of all list members. In order to achieve this, each list has a public and private key. (The private keys optionally protected by passphrases) Furthermore, new list settings are defined: gpg_postings_allowed: is it allowed to send to this list postings which are encrypted with the GPG list key? gpg_msg_distribution: are subscribers allowed (or even forced) to upload their GPG public key in order to receive all messages encrypted? gpg_post_sign: should posts be GPG signed with an acknowledged subscriber key before being distributed? gpg_msg_sign: should the server sign encrypted messages?

{"description":"Jaap Akkerhuis Jaap Akkerhuis (1951) is a scientist, researcher and engineer that has been instrumental in the development of the Internet since the early eighties. He started his career in 1979 at the Computer Laboratory of the Mathematical Centre (current name: Centrum voor Wiskunde & Informatica ), which in the years that followed established itself as the center of European computer networks. Inside the small team led by Teus Hagen he was responsible for most actual networking activities. In addition to his regular scientific tasks, Akkerhuis spent countless nights and weekends in setting up and debugging connections and first international gateways - for countries all the way up to Australia, via Japan and South-Korea. Well before the first official public connection to the internet outside of the USA was made at CWI, he personally convinced Jon Postel to allocate him a range of IP-addresses to avoid future collisions. While many of the other pioneers stayed in Europe, Akkerhuis went back and forth between scientific institutes, research labs, internet service providers and registries in Europe and across the USA - thereby playing a key role as a global connector in the technical community. Akkerhuis is appreciated by many for his no-nonsense approach and lack of ego. He made a flood of technical and organisational contributions over the years, for instance in inventing an improvised modem that used a repurposed plotter (which was originally used to make technical drawing) to instead rotate the dial of vintage pre-DTMF phones - effectively created an automatic modem which could be used to set up connections without manual intervention. In 1987 Akkerhuis moved to the US to join the Information Technology Centre at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA), followed by another two years at Mt. Xinu (Berkeley, CA.) and three years at Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill, NJ). In 1995 he returned to the Netherlands to join NLnet, the first Dutch ISP. In 1999 he joined the newly established Dutch ccTLD (SIDN). In 2004 he became a Research Engineer at NLnet Labs, an independent not-for-profit research and development lab renowned for its work on a.o. DNSSEC and BGP Security. Throughout his career Akkerhuis spent a truly generous amount of time sharing his knowledge with others, in organisations such as EUUG, USENIX, IETF, Internet Society, RIPE, ICANN and CENTR. At USENIX he was on both on the Editorial Advisory Board and production editor of Computing Systems. He served as a co-chair for the IETF ProvReg Working Group, and still is co-chair of the RIPE DNS working group. He was member of the Permanent Stakeholders Group of ENISA and has acted as an occasional instructor for ISOC courses for TLD registries. He has served in ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee since its inception. He is a member of the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency, which maintains the authoritative list of country codes. He remains an active ports maintainer in FreeBSD. Outside of the internet world, Jaap Akkerhuis is a member of the Stanford Solar Center and SuperSID Software Committee.

{"description":"History The non-profit NLnet Foundation was formally started in 1989, but incorporates networking activities which go back as early as 1982. The foundation (in Dutch called \"Stichting NLnet\" or shortly \"NLnet\") has played a major role in raising the so-called pan-European \"UNIX\" Network and the commercial and public internet network provision in Holland. Some NLnet milestones are: the first internet backbone in Holland, the first local dial-in and ISDN infrastructure with full country coverage, and the definition and implementation of a low cost connectivity structure. These activities caused Amsterdam to become the major exchange point for European internet traffic. People like Piet Beertema, Daniel Karrenberg, Ted Lindgreen, and the employees of NLnet have played a major role for NLnet and the internet in Europe. In the summer of 1997, the Foundation sold its commercialized internet provision activities to UUNET (the internet subsidiary of WorldCom), which was later renamed into Verizon.

The project's own website Encrypted communication between two random end points on the internet cannot happen without additional infrastructure through which security parameters are exchanged. DANE (DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities) is a method of bootstrapping encrypted TLS channels without third parties (i.e. Certificate Authorities) having to vouch for a name. It provides the owner of the name the means to authenticate the keys used for their TLS enabled services themselves, by putting the key material (or a reference for it) in the DNSSEC signed zone for the name. DNSSEC validation is an absolute requirement to verify DANE enabled TLS sessions. DANE was recently added as a mandatory standard of the Dutch government by Forum Standaardisatie together with startTLS. Applications that employ DANE to setup TLS connections need to be able to retrieve and verify DNSSEC records reliably. New work in TLS, embedding DANE in an extension, needs to be able to validate DNSSEC to authenticate a TLS session (see: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-dnssec-chain-extension-01). Because of the technical complexity of DNSSEC, DANE support has so far been quite complex for developers to work with.

{"description":"FTEproxy [Format-Transforming Encryption -- concluded on 2015/01/01] fteproxy provides transport-layer protection to resist keyword filtering, censorship and discriminatory routing policies. Its job is to relay datastreams, such as web browsing traffic, by encoding streams as messages that match a user-specified regular expression. The project's own website Network communications are increasingly becoming the target of surveillance and censorship. One natural defense is to use traditional cryptographic protocols &emdash; traditional encryption incurs low-overhead and does a good job of providing privacy. However, because encryption is so effective, many governments (e.g., Iran, Pakistan, and China) are willing to block state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols such as TLS and SSH. Figure 1: A government can easily identify that a client and server are using an encryption protocol, and refuse the connection. Our Solution: Format-Transforming Encryption Format-Transforming Encryption (FTE) is a novel cryptographic primitive that extends traditional encryption. Traditional cryptographic primitives take a key and a message as input, and output an unformatted ciphertext. FTE takes a key, message and format (a compact set descriptor) as input and outputs a ciphertext in the format set. As an example, a format may describe the set of valid messages from an uncensored protocol, such as HTTP. The software that realizes Format-Transforming Encryption, fteproxy, bootstraps FTE to relay arbitrary data streams. fteproxy uses regular expressions to describe and transmit messages from an uncensored protocol (e.g., HTTP), but may actually be relaying a censored protocol (e.g., Tor, TLS, SSH, etc.) To a government, traffic looks like HTTP, even though it may actually be a censored protocol.

{"description":"e-Passports [Authenticating users over the Internet using e-Passports -- concluded on 2009/11/01] Over the past two years, electronic passports (e-passports) have been introduced in most countries of the world. An e-passport embeds a chip with card holder details. While there are concerns about the privacy consequences of the introduction, caused by the contactless nature of communication and the sensitive nature of contained biometric data, these also presents a unique opportunity: it provides every citizen of the world with a strong authentication token within a global Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The technical standards which describe how to verify the authenticity of electronic passports are open and publicly available from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Although likely not intended as such by ICAO, e-passports are ideal for authenticating users of Web services. The current proposal intends to build such an Identity 2.0 solution with open source software. We propose to create a trustworthy identity solution that allows a user to use their e-passport for authentication at regular websites or webservices (e.g. for e-government like services). Such a solution may contain a browser plug-in that integrates the software developed in JMRTD with an open source identity selector (perhaps compatible with InfoCard). Additionally, the solution may require the establishment of a central server that acts as an identity provider (perhaps compatible with OpenID). A question that will need to be answered is to what degree end-users and service providers need to trust our identity provider (in case of end-users: trust with respect to dealing with privacy sensitive data).","title":"e-Passports","url":"/project/epassports/"},
{"description":"DIME [DIME] The DIME project has three distinct goals: to make end-to-end email encryption transparent and automatic, to minimize the leakage of metadata, and to enshrine the standards which make automation resistant to manipulation by advanced persistent threats. This has led to the development of a set of protocols and data formats which combine the best of current technologies into an integrated system that gives adequate protection, yet remains flexible. It allows for people to improve their security without sacrificing functionality. The project's own website In today’s networked and asynchronous world, email continues to be at the heart of our online conversations, and despite its detractors, continues to grow in significance. Last year, over 2.6 billion people used email, exchanging nearly 205 billion messages per day. Yet the percentage of messages protected by end-to-end encryption remains so small, that it makes those who encrypt automatic \"targets\" and large-scale commercial adoption economically challenging. Email as it is currently being used is insecure, unreliable, and easily readable by any attacker in a post-Snowden world. DIME seeks to establish an open standard capable of simultaneously providing security by default and preserving the benefits email users have come to expect. DIME follows in the footsteps of innovative email protocols, but takes advantage of the lessons learned during the 20-year history of PGP/GPG. DIME is federated, remains a store and forward medium, and allows strangers to contact each other securely. Anyone with a domain name can deploy a DIME compatible server and begin enjoying the benefits of DIME. \"DIME\" is supported by NLnet and the Internet Hardening Fund .","title":"DIME","url":"/project/dime/"},

{"description":"Assessing Cyber Security [Assessing Cyber Security -- concluded on 2015/04/16] Over the years, a plethora of reports has emerged that assess the causes, dynamics, and effects of cyber threats. This proliferation of reports is an important sign of the increasing prominence of cyber attacks for organizations, both public and private, and citizens all over the world. In addition, cyber attacks are drawing more and more attention in the media. Such efforts can help to better awareness and understanding of cyber threats and pave the way to improved prevention, mitigation, and resilience. This report aims to help in this task by assessing what we know about cyber security threats based on a review of 70 studies published by public authorities, companies, and research organizations from about 15 countries over the last few years. It answers the following questions: what do we know about the number, origin, and impact of cyber attacks? What are the current and emerging cyber security trends? And how well are we prepared to face these threats? The focus of the examined reports differs widely. Some reports look at all possible cyber attacks, others zoom in on specific threats such as Distributed Denial of Service attacks or malware. Some reports focus on a specific sector, or one country, others have a global scope. Methodologies used by the reports are often inconsistent and sometimes opaque: some are based on self-reporting (e.g., surveys), while others use data generated by software. One of the main observations of our study is that the range of estimates in the examined investigations is so wide, even experts find it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. This leads to the conclusion that, although there is no shortage in the number of reports, well defined and comparable cyber threat data and risk assessments are missing.

Sometimes we even see lock-in arrangements from vendors. This project aims to overcome these barriers and unleash the true power of the underlying technology platform - it designs and builds open source firmware for digital phones. The project makes full use of the exiting capabilities of DNSSEC, ZRTP and IPv6: DNSSEC secures the information looked up on remote parties; ZRTP secures conversations and if it is missing, this will be explicitly communicated to end users. Direct media streams between IPv4 endpoints can only be built up using sophisticated handling like port forwarding, but remains dependent of many factors, while IPv6 simplifies and improves SIP technology immensely. Especially the clever usage of IPv6 makes 0cpm an exiting project. Many people see IPv6 as something to avoid as long as they can because they are afraid of technical headache. This project shows that IPv6 is nothing to fear and offers exiting opportunities. For instance the fact that every RTP media stream can use random end point addresses which can be abandoned after the stream stops. Also it is possible to send IPv6 adresses of different devices in one SIP INVITE message, which is almost impossible to do behind IPv4 NAT. This will allow you to send video of a conversation to your television and simultaneously speak through your telephone. Project administered by: OpenFortress","title":"0cpm","url":"/project/0cpm/"},
{"url":"/project/virtnet/description.html","description":"VirtNet; description [Network Stack Virtualization -- concluded on 2007/04] FreeBSD network stack virtualization FreeBSD jail [1] is a widely accepted framework for application environment isolation. Processes running inside jails have a restricted view of resources provided by the operating system, most notably, they are unable to directly interact with other processes outside the scope of their own jailed environment. Combined with restricting jail's network visibility to a single system IP address while confining the file system access to a private directory tree, the jail model provides isolation capabilities sufficient to allow system administrators to host tens or hundreds of such environments on a single physical machine while delegating per-jail superuser authorities to other parties. In other words, a jail can be thought of as an isolated lightweight virtual host with its own (potentially untrusted) system administrator, users and applications; while sharing the base OS kernel and physical system resources with other such environments. This concept, first introduced in FreeBSD 4.0, proved so successful that not only it become a platform of choice for many application hosting providers, but it lead to introduction of similar features in operating systems other than FreeBSD, such as zones in Sun's Solaris or the Linux Vserver project. While providing less rigid levels of isolation compared to traditional hardware virtualization architectures such as IBM's z-Series platform or more recent paravirtualization models such as Xen [2], the main attraction and strength of FreeBSD's jail concept lies in its scalability and efficient usage of hardware resources. One shortcoming of the original jail model is that it exposes a very restricted set of networking facilities to jailed applications. Network stack settings such as IP addresses, routes or firewall rules can be administered only from the global OS context, not from within the jails themselves. Delegating the authority to manage the network stack settings to jailed super-users would require independent copies of network stack state variables to be kept on a per-jail basis. Precisely such a model was experimentally implemented as an extension to FreeBSD 4.7 kernel [3]: the existing networking kernel code was modified to operate on multiple clonable structures where most of the networking-related state is kept. Such a new virtualized network stack model turned out to provide a great flexibility to perjail local administrators. Each jail-style environment could control multiple private network interfaces with multiple IP addresses, could maintain and control its own firewall ruleset, routing tables, address translators, traffic shapers etc. In short, looking from the networking perspective, the network stack cloning model blurred the line between the traditional hardware (or para-) virtualization architectures and jail-style lightweight virtual machines. Most importantly, the experimental implementation proved that the overhead of the network stack virtualization was neglectable, so that the performance advantage of jails over traditional server virtualization models was preserved. Besides for virtual hosting applications, the clonable network stack model enabled the OS kernel to be used as a highly scalable and efficient network topology emulator, by constructing arbitrarily complex kernel-level virtual topologies composed of network stack instances ( nodes ) and netgraph-based explicit links [4].

The truly revolutionary aspect of Turtle rests in its novel way of dealing with trust issues. Where other P2P architectures attempt to build trust relationships on top of a trust-agnostic P2P overlay, Turtle builds its overlay on top of pre-existent trust relationships among its users. This allows both data sender and receiver anonymity. At the same time, it protects each intermediate relay in the data query path. Furthermore, its trust model should allow Turtle to withstand most of the denial of service attacks that plague other peer-to-peer data sharing networks. A high-level description of the Turtle protocol can be found in a paper (PDF) presented at the Cambridge Security Protocols Workshop in 2004. Each user acts as node in the overlay by running a copy of the Turtle client software on his computer. In contrast to other P2P systems, Turtle does not allow anytwo arbitrary nodes to connect and exchange information. Instead, each user will only connect her node to a limited number of other nodes, which are run by people she trusts (her friends). Before establishing a connection, there is an authentication phase, in order to prevent masquerading. The data is exchanged among friend nodes over secure encrypted links in order to guarantee confidentiality. When a Turtle user looks for an item in the network, the query is initially sent only to her friends' Turtle nodes. The friends forward the query to their friends, and so on, up to a given query depth. Query results follow the reverse path, travelling across friendship connections back to the query originator. This way data is only exchanged between people that trust each other. As the data is always encrypted, the adversary has no way to determine who is requesting or providing information, and what that information is about. Social science research (like the famous \"six degrees of separation\" experiment) and existing internet systems (like the PGP public key infrastructure and the Orkut online community) have shown that the social graphs are extremely scalable. These graphs, on which also Turtle relies, have the ability to connect very large communities through a small number of hops (usually less than 6). Finally, one important property resulting from the way the Turtle overlay is constructed is confined damage; a security break in one Turtle node only affects a small subset of the system: only the node itself and its friends. The goal of this NLnet project is to develop the Turtle P2P client software, and to offer it to the general public under the GPL public license.","title":"Turtle; Description"},
{"url":"/project/timewalker/summary.html","description":"TimeWalker; Product summary Theo de Ridder - Pim Buurman 1. Introduction Many systems produce huge amounts of timestamped data (events) like logs from systemcalls, time-series from network monitoring or transactions from database-applications. In practice eventdata is often thrown away without any inspection. Some of the main reasons are: waste of resources, poor dataformats, non-scalability of traditional tools, lack of an adequate visual instrument. However, throwing away eventdata unseen implies losing essential information needed to discover cause-effect relations within (un)wanted or (un)expected systembehaviour. TimeWalker is a tool that makes preservation and disclosure of historical details contained in eventdata attractive and feasible. The implementation and user-interface are made very flexible and portable by using wxPython and C. The first release of TimeWalker will become available(under a GPL-licence) in november 2001 for Win32 and Linux. In this release TimeWalker will work smoothly for about 500000 records in memory that represent individual events or aggregated events collected from much larger (Gb) datasets. 2. Data handling TimeWalker unifies arbitrary eventformats into a format that enables a much better performance for persistent storage, aggregation and transformation than can be obtained by using a (traditional) database. Aggregation is the process of compressing arbitrary eventlists into a fixed-time interval sequence containing a single composite record in each interval. With user-specified expressions important correlations can be preserved during aggregation. Aggregated records can be transformed with user-specified expressions into values to plotted. The clean syntax and semantics of Python is used for all expressions at the user level. Some specific internal techniques are used to improve the performance of the produced byte-code drastically. 3. Visualizing techniques TimeWalker uses an innovative technique for information-visualisation along the time-axis that enables simultaneous presentation of context and detail of eventdata in a range from 40 years down to 5 minutes. The technique is based on a sliding hierarchical ZoomLens that shows a bundle of multiple beams with predefined (quarter, week, day, hour, 5 min) time-scales. The zoomlens can be shifted by hand or be started as an animation. The graphical user-interface as a whole is carefully designed for quick pattern-recognition by a regular user. Each part has a fixed place, there is no scrolling, the information density is high, scaling and coloring is automatic, and there is (almost) no static and redundant (textual) information. Apart from the graphical mainwindow there are also frames for textual browsing and manipulating configuration data, metadata, raw data, documentation, and even (parts of) the reflective running environment. All textual navigation is based on data-driven tree/table-grid combinations. Graphical and textual visualisations are both interactive and scale up with realtime performance for very large datasets. 4. Usage There is a general datacollector, with derivations available for some common dataformats like syslog. Experience showed that creating and testing a new collector can be done within one day. The use of expressions for aggregations and transformations on itself is not complicated, but making the right choices requires domain knowledge as well as some experience with the resulting visual effects. TimeWalker is supports visual datamining of huge amounts of non-filtered eventdata. It can be considered as a multi-focal looking glass complementary to the limitations of the usual spreadsheet way of (statistical) datareduction.

{"url":"/project/sesame/description.html","title":"Sesame; Description","description":"Sesame; description [storage and querying middleware for the Semantic Web -- concluded on 2006/03] The Semantic Web In his book Weaving the Web, Tim Berners-Lee talks about the vision that inspired him to invent the World Wide Web. Although the Web as we know it today has already changed everyday life, facilitating communication between people all over the world as if they were each other'ss neighbours, Tim Berners-Lee's vision has yet to be fulfilled. The Web, as he saw it, included machines communicating with people and with each other, rather than people just using machines to talk to one another. He calls this web The Semantic Web. The Semantic Web is about the meaning of information, whereas the current World Wide Web is only about the information itself. For machines to be able to communicate with each other and with people, they will need a common understanding of what information means. For this, machine processable meta-information --&nbsp;information about the information&nbsp;-- is needed. The World Wide Web Consortium, founded by Tim Berners-Lee, has been working on (and still works on) standards for defining this machine processable meta-information. The now omnipresent language XML was the first step. The next step was the definition of RDF (Resource Description Format), a format that allows you to define anything about everything and that uses XML as an interchange syntax. Next steps include the definition of languages for modelling information so that it becomes machine understandable. First inroads in this direction have been made with RDF Schema, OIL and DAML+OIL, languages which will serve as important input to the new Web-Ontology Working Group. Sesame Sesame is a software program that was originally developed in the IST-project On-To-Knowledge, which also produced the OIL language. In this project, a storage and querying service for RDF and RDF Schema was developed. This software was baptized Sesame. The most important features of Sesame are: Scalability Sesame has been designed with scalability as its primary focus. By design, it is able to scale from handhelds to powerful enterprise servers. Powerful query language The supported query language RQL is the only language of its kind, offering native support for RDF Schema semantics. Portability Sesame is written completely in Java, allowing it to be run on all mainstream platforms. Repository independence Sesame abstracts from the actual repository being used for storing data. This allows Sesame to be run on top of any DBMS, or even on completely different kinds of repositories. Extensibility Sesame's architecture allows for other functional modules to be plugged in, thus adding new functionality to the program. Flexible communication The architecture separates the communication details from the actual functionality through the use of protocol handlers. Supporting other communication protocols is only a matter of adding the appropriate protocol handler. As the amount of available meta-data grows, the need for a scalable repository and accompanying querying service will arise. Being able to offer this, Sesame has the potential to become an important building block of the Semantic Web. The flexibility and openness of Sesame's architecture will allow it to be integrated in a wide variety of applications."},
{"url":"/project/sesame/20031204-final.html","description":"Final report Open Sesame project 1. Background of Sesame Sesame is a Java software toolkit and server architecture for storing, querying and inferencing over RDF and RDF Schema, the description models that drive the vision of the Semantic Web. Automated processing of RDF-based metadata on the web requires software that supports expressive querying, scalable storage and that can reason with the information provided in the metadata. Sesame's purpose is to provide this functionality in a variety of deployment scenarios, both as a Java software library and as an easy-to-deploy web-enabled database server. 2. Goals of the project As defined in the Open Sesame project proposal, the overall goal of the Open Sesame project was defined as succesful distribution and development of Sesame as Open Source software. To this end, the project was defined in terms of project tasks. In this report, we will briefly address how each task has been completed within this project. 3. Tasks [T1 + T2] Code base preparation and infrastructure setup The code base was cleaned up, and proper code commentary and javadoc documentation was added. The complete Sesame codebase has been made publicly available through a public CVS server on the Sourceforge.net site. Mailinglists for feedback and for developer discussions were set up. [T3] Creation of an installation procedure Detailed installation/configuration documentation was created. Also, a graphical user interface for easy remote maintenance of Sesame servers was developed. [T4] Writing tutorial documentation on RQL and Sesame Tutorials and user manuals were created for Sesame, for RQL and for its followup query language, SeRQL. [T5] Developement of an API for communication with repositories A client library for HTTP access to Sesame servers was developed. More recently, a revised API for repository-based access was developed that will allow more flexible deployment of Sesame in a variety of environments. [T6] Implementation of a generic SQL Repository Abstraction Layer During the project, the RAL was renamed to SAIL (Storage And Inference Layer), and made more generic. Currently, the SAIL consists of a set of generic interfaces and a number of implementations. A generic SQL implementation supports major database platforms such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle 9. An in-memory implementation supports fast non-persistent storage of RDF models. [T7] Implementation of complete support for RQL in the query engine Initially, the RQL engine was updated regularly to follow the specs. However, divergence in the needs of the Sesame user community and the agenda of the developers of the RQL spec led to the development of a new query language, called SeRQL, which is more suited to the needs of the Sesame user community and is regarded by many in the RDF community as a very strong contender for a QL standardization effort. SeRQL is as expressive, if not more so, as RQL. Also, a third query engine was developed for Sesame, supporting the popular low-level query language RDQL. This query language is also supported by several other RDF tools, such as Jena. Summarizing, after completing this task, Sesame now supports three query languages: SeRQL, RDQL and RQL. [T8] Implementation of partial support for DAML+OIL querying During the course of the project, the scope of this task has been widened to supporting inferencing on RDF-based models. The main focus of this task has been the development of an exhaustive forward chaining inferencer for RDF and RDF Schema, that supports the semantics of RDF as defined by the RDF Model Theory. After successful completion of a prototype implementation, focus shifted to improving the performance of the inference. The followup of DAML+OIL is OWL. A start has been made with supporting the more complex metamodel of OWL through a customizable rule-based inferencer.

{"url":"/project/parrot/description.html","title":"Parrot; Description","description":"Parrot; description [Parrot -- concluded on 2009/06] Development of Parrot Parrot is related to Perl&nbsp;6, but it is not Perl&nbsp;6. To find out what it actually is, we need to know a little about how Perl works. When you feed your program into perl, it is first compiled into an internal representation, or bytecode; then this bytecode is fed to an almost separate subsystem inside perl to be interpreted. So there are two distinct phases of perl's operation -compilation to bytecode, and interpretation of bytecode. This is not unique to Perl; other languages following this design include Python, Ruby, Tcl and, believe it or not, even Java. In previous versions of Perl, this arrangement has been pretty ad hoc: there hasn't been any overarching design to the interpreter or the compiler, and the interpreter has ended up being pretty reliant on certain features of the compiler. Nevertheless, the interpreter (some languages call it a Virtual Machine) can be thought of as a software CPU -the compiler produces \"machine code\" instructions for the virtual machine, which it then executes, much like a C compiler produces machine code to be run on a real CPU. Perl&nbsp;6 plans to separate out the design of the compiler and the interpreter. This is why we've come up with a subproject, which we've called Parrot, which has a certain, limited amount of independence from Perl&nbsp;6. Parrot is destined to be the Perl&nbsp;6 Virtual Machine, the software CPU on which we will run Perl&nbsp;6 bytecode. We're working on Parrot before we work on the Perl&nbsp;6 compiler because it's much easier to write a compiler once you've got a target to compile to! The name \"Parrot\" was chosen after the 2001 April Fool's Joke which had Perl and Python collaborating on the next version of their interpreters. This is meant to reflect the idea that we'd eventually like other languages to use Parrot as their VM; in a sense, we'd like Parrot to become a \"common language runtime\" for dynamic languages."},

As usual, there were also plenty of bug fixes, and in particular much of the code was reviewed as part of the effort to complete the PMC (Parrot Magic Cookie) design. I'm very happy to report that the Parrot team has met the milestones in the new, much more aggressive schedule laid out by Allison, and is on track to meet the coming November 1st milestones as well. Allison has completed the Events design document (PDD24). Patrick Michaud has completed the design for the AST Interface (PDD26) and is working on its implementation, aiming to be done at the beginning of November. In October, Allison spoke on Parrot at the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop and led a Parrot hackathon at there as well. Kevin Farnham, a developer who writes for the O'Reilly Network, wrote a blog post about using Parrot with libraries build with Intel's Threaded Building Blocks ( the article ). Paul Cochrane, one of the Parrot developers, did some analysis of commit and release frequency for Parrot since its inception. The trend of this data shows an increasing level of activity over the lifetime of the project, which is a good indicator of the project's health. It's also important to note that there is sharp change in the number of commits right at the time of the first payment from this grant (April of 2005). This is strong evidence that the grant is serving its intended purpose of drawing in new developers and generally increasing interest and activity in Parrot. The graph and statistics can be found on the front page of the Parrot wiki. In this past grant period, a $2,000 payment was issued to Patrick Michaud for completing the AST Interface design.

This is a major accomplishment, as the design work on IO impacts much of Parrot's design, including areas such as concurrency and networking. This work was completed by Allison with help and review by Jerry Gay. The next area Allison will be focusing on is the object design, which is necessary in order for implementation work to begin on IO. On December 16 and January 13, the Parrot development team held \"Parrot Bug Days\" to stimulate interest in Parrot and provide a way for newcomers to work on the project, with guidance from experienced Parrot developers. These have been a great success, fixing many outstanding bugs, and the team plans to continue doing this on a monthly basis. Jerry Gay, working as release manager, released Parrot 0.4.8 on January 16th. Besides the IO PDD, this release includes significant work on the parser/compiler tool chain, and greatly improved support for various Perl&nbsp;6 features, including hashes, arrays, method calls, and more. Patrick Michaud has led the work on the compiler and Perl&nbsp;6 implementation. In 0.4.8, the Tcl implementation (ParTcl) now passes almost 25% of the cvs Tcl test suite, thanks in large part to work by Will Coleda and Matt Diephouse.

Most of this development work is aimed at improving the Lire framework, making it easier for users to configure and use the software in a way which suits them best. History of LogReport Stichting LogReport Foundation was established in August 2000 with the help of Stichting NLnet, and started serious development of the Lire software in October 2000. From October 2000 until July 2003 approximately 30 manmonths of paid effort have been spent on development of the software and documentation, setup of website and online responder service, and promotion at various conferences and on-line magazines. All of this was paid for by subsidies received from NLnet for a total of &euro;253.500. In addition a significant number of volunteers have contributed many small chunks of code for integration into the Lire system. In 2002 some initial attempts were made to spin off a commercial entity \"logreport.com\" which would sell LogReport consultancy and develop \"specials\", while continuing to contribute to the GPL'ed source base. But this did not seem to lead to viable results. The foundation thus has concentrated on using its remaining resources to bring the Lire software to a state where it can live on from mainly volunteer contributions. The internals have been reworked for more flexibility, and to make it easier for less experienced developers to contribute code like new converters and analyzers. Current status Lire 1.3 has been released in May 2003 and represents the most current version of the software (a small number of corrections have been committed to the CVS tree since). Judging from the number of downloads, the software is reasonably popular, in a wide variety of environments. This is also confirmed by the subscriptions to and the traffic on the various LogReport mailing lists. The plans from October/November 2002 to complete a 2.0 release in the same time frame proved to be too optimistic. LogReport's remaining funds are close to zero, and an effort has been made to reduce the recurring costs of hosting the web server and log responder by moving it to to NLnet Labs (thanks for their cooperation!). No staff is employed anymore at this moment. Plan for 2.0 It is clear that the silver bullet for transforming Lire and LogReport into a community-supported project thriving on volunteer code contributions and release management has not been found yet, and probably will never be found since it probably does not exist ... However, we think we can improve LogReport's chances for continued impact on the world of Open Source generic logfile analysis and reporting tools by embarking on a revised 2.0 development plan (attached below). The proposed work is concentrated on the internals of Lire, a relatively complex area for which outside volunteer contributions are hardly to be expected (and have not been received in the past years). A very important byproduct of this work will be a considerable performance improvement, something which is high on the wishlist of high-volume Lire users. If funds are made available for implementing the 2.0 development work, Stichting LogReport Foundation intends to award a fixed-price contract for this for a total of &euro;&nbsp;38.400 to Francis Lacoste. Francis Lacoste, based in Montreal, has been on the Lire development team since June 2001, and is the chief architect of the current product. He will employ a second developer, Wolfgang Sourdeau, also based in Montreal, to speed up the work, and possibly improved quality as a result of \"pair-programming\". Completion of 2.0 is expected well before the end of 2003. The contract costs have been established like this: basic estimate 74 mandays; 20% extra for estimation errors, pair-programming etc.; 10 days extra for release engineering; The resulting total of 99 mandays has been rounded up to 100","title":"Subsidy Request Lire-2.0"},

The new draft and web resources are available at http://gplv3.fsf.org. We welcome your comments on the wording of the new version at http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Draft 1 of Version 3, 16 Jan 2006 THIS IS A DRAFT, NOT A PUBLISHED VERSION OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make requirements that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. For the developers' and author's protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, the GPL ensures that recipients are told that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Some countries have adopted laws prohibiting software that enables users to escape from Digital Restrictions Management. DRM is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to protect users' freedom; therefore, the GPL ensures that the software it covers will neither be subject to, nor subject other works to, digital restrictions from which escape is forbidden. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the special danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL makes it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. Definitions. A \"licensed program\" means any program or other work distributed under this License.

Foundation Randomdata [March 2010] Randomdata is a hackerspace where people with common interests, usually in technology meet, socialize and collaborate. The Randomdata hackerspace is an open community lab, workbench, machine shop, workshop and/or studio where people of diverse backgrounds come together to share resources and knowledge to build/make things. Foundation RaumZeitLabor [March 2010] Foundation RaumZeitLabor is a Hackerspace in the Rhein-Neckar area. It is a meetingplace for hackers in the area. It is similar to existing Hackerspaces around the world, but there is no such space in a 50km radius around Heidelberg/Mannheim. Most of our group will focus on hardware --making circuits, CNC mills, rapid prototyping.

Simon Josefsson to IPR-wg [Initiated 11 November 2005] NLnet supported the visit of Simon Josefsson (Stockholm, Sweden) to the IPR-wg during IETF&nbsp;64 in Vancouver (Canada), with a donation of &euro;500 to cover travel expenses. In the working group, Simon expressed his concerns about various problems with copying permissions for RFCs and other IETF contributions. Read the travel report in HTML or PDF. Participation in FreeNIX Guido van Rooij is the security officer in the FreeBSD 's project core team, in addition to a number of other positions. The NLnet Foundation sponsored his activities is to help stimulate the formation of an active group of people around FreeNIX/ Open Source within the NLUUG community. Such a group would be a good source for feature requests with respect to Open Source software. NLnet Foundation's interests are primarily network related topics. A small group of people has been formed, and an e-mail list was maintained for about one and a half year but has since been closed down due to lack of traffic. However, a useful side-effect of this activity has been the formation of a new special interest group (SIG) of the NLUUG under the name NLFUG, the Netherlands FreeBSD Users Group. In January 2002, the NLFUG was renamed into D-Bug, the Dutch BSD User Group. The D-BUG ( website ) aims at bundling the interests of the Dutch *BSD (primarily FreeBSD) community.","title":"Donations; Description"},

Background Simon Josefsson Datakonsult (SJD) has for the past few years developed several free software implementations of IETF protocols, including GNU Libidn used for Internationalized Domain Names; GNU SASL, GNU Shishi and GNU GSS used for user authentication. SJD currently also maintain GnuTLS. SJD participates in the IETF since the late 1990s, with several published documents related to the Domain Name System, and is initial co-designer of the PEAP protocol for Wireless LAN user authentication. SJD is an active participant in several Security area working groups, and is editing documents targetted for the SASL, KRB-WG, and OPENPGP working groups. SJD discovered in early 2003 that the IETF license on RFCdocuments may present a problem when they are incorporated in free software products. The concern is that it should be possible to include excerpts from RFCs in free software products. The current IETF license does not permit this, but many free software projects need that right. The issue was discussed on the general IETF list during 2004. The Free Software Foundation was contacted, and agreed with the interpretation that the IETF license is not free. Since mid-2005, SJD has pursued this issue within the IPR WG. During October 2005 SJD devloped his own proposal to solve the problem, and has since been pushing for it within the IPR WG. With the financial help from Stiching NLnet and other contributors, and with the support of the Debian community and around 40 individuals, and examples of problems caused for the FreeBSD community and the Sun Solaris operating system, together with examples from several specific free software projects, SJD went to Vancouver for the IETF 64 IPR meeting to present the issue, to raise awareness and to listen to the IETF community discussion. Further information can be found in my article Problems with the IETF's copying permissions. Offline meeting Before the IPR WG session, SJD met with Harald Alvestrand (acting IPR WG chair), Jorge Contreras (IETF lawyer) and Scott Bradner (author of RFC3978) for about one hour. The meeting consisted of going through the current license and our presentations. SJD expressed a wish to add the word \"perpetual\" to the rights granted for use and distribution of RFCs. SJD explained in more detail the examples given in the draft. Alvestrand asked SJD to remove the discussion about process issues from the presentation, and SJD did so in order to give more time for forward-looking discussions. Meeting notes The IPR WG met for one hour on November 8 at 18.50. The meeting started with presentation of the IPR Trust (12 minutes), an introduction of the main topic by the acting WG chair (5 minutes), Scott Bradner's presentation and discussion (30 minutes), SJD's presentation (8 minutes) and David Black's presentation (5 minutes). Due to the poor scheduling, there were no time for an open mike. The agenda suggested there would be 30 minutes of open mike time. The main focus of the meeting became the inbound rights, granted from contributors to the IETF. This was not anticipated to be a controversial matter. After Scott's presentation, a show of hands was performed, indicating strong support for giving IETF the ability to grant others sub-licenses to IETF Contributions. The issue of outbound rights, from the IETF to third parties, was discussed in the last 13 minutes with no input from the audience. SJD believes the IPR WG meeting was badly run by the acting WG chair, Harald Alvestrand, in that no open mike time was given, despite the WG agenda clearly allocating time for it. As a result of this, little community input was received. Still, in the few minutes that were given, SJD had a chance of going through the examples of where the current IETF license causes problems. It is hoped that the audience recognized and could identify with some of","title":"Trip report for IETF 64 IPR meeting"},

During this project phase, continuous progress is made in the implementation of Decibel. The goal of this phase was to establish a full telephony stack for testing and demonstration. Further goals were to strengthen the KDE community interaction and the integration of the software into the KDE project. In order to reach out for more recognition, documentation and community communication got more attention. The deliverables of this phase are: rework website project description to be better understandable and more appealing; API reference manual (also on website); presentation at the akademy conference; Mini CTI stack consisting of: simple Qt GUI for phone use using the new Decibel client library Decibel + Tapioca + Telepathy CTI connection manager for SNOM hardware VoIP phone release of Decibel. Furthermore, the KDE developers decided to move Decibel into the `playground' directory of KDE's SVN server. Software in this directory get much more developer attention than in the branches where Decibel was hosted before. The next step in development is to port the application KCall to Decibel, so that it can function as a Decibel front-end to users. It is intended to push Decibel into the codebase of KDE becoming an integral part of the KDE 4.1 release. As a result of the discussion with the Telepathy team, the Decibel specification was extended to include more telephone specific CTI functionality. In the next project phase this functionality will be integrated into Tapioca and Decibel as well as made available from the client GUIs. The website of the project has seen a relaunch with an improved structure. Documentation and HowTos were added in order to ease the application of Decibel. The restructured web site with added reference documentation on the provided APIs make Decibel better understandable to new developers and users. The intension is to make it easier for contributors and other interested parties to see the benefit in Decibel and what it can be used for. For the next phases of the project, plans are to add a whitepaper on the Decibel technology and to further improve the public documentation. The project results will be exhibited at the SYSTEMS 2007 fair, in the Open Source park between other free software projects. The project team of basysKom GmbH will join KDE with its booth and demonstrate Decibel to a business audience.","title":"Decibel project status"},

This quarter improvements to the community process were made and the implementation of the framework has begun. This is the second project report of this project. Important Developments Developments in related Projects. Since the first project report was written the Tapioca project has changed focus due to our intervention. It now implements the Telepathy specification, providing an alternative language bindings not available in Telepathy itself and strives to improve the developer experience of working with Telepathy. This change brings us improved compatibility while preserving the more high-level development environment offered by Tapioca and makes it easier to implement a common solution bridging desktop environments. Developments in the Community Process. We gave a presentation on Decibel at the KDE developer meeting aKademy 2006 in Dublin. The reaction of the KDE application developers was very positive. The Telepathy project and the Gnome community was represented at this conference by Robert McQueen, Robert Taylor and Dafydd Harries. Their reaction to our \"Mission Control\" daemon called Houston was very positive as well. We agreed that it would make sense to come up with a shared API for \"Mission Control\" functionality. A shared implementation was not considered feasible since that would not integrate well into both KDE and Gnome: A \"Mission Control\" must integrate tightly into the infrastructure of the desktop to improve the user experience. During and after the conference we had many fruitful discussions with the developers of the KDE instant messaging application Kopete. In a BoF session at aKademy, the requirements of application developers were evaluated. Applications enabled by a communication infrastructure like Decibel were discussed. This BoF was further used by Robert McQueen to give an introduction to Telepathy. The developers were interested in finding out how Decibel could be used to enable users to collaborate at their tasks. Completed Work Packages (The numbers of work packages relate to those in the original project plan) Work-Package 2.1: Extend and integrate DBus protocol Qt bindings to Telepathy's DBus API were written and are available in Tapioca's SVN repository (and are already included in Ubuntu/edgy due in October). These bindings were written in close cooperation with the Tapioca developers. Tapioca-Qt was started to offer a more high-level access to the functionality provided by Telepathy-Qt. Again, this work is done in collaboration with the Tapioca developers. Ongoing Work Work-Package 2.2: Extend Mission Control The \"Mission Control\" component had to be rechristened to Houston. Implementation of it has started. Currently the components encapsulating the Telepathy Connection Managers is implemented as well as a management API for the accounts of the user. These components are covered by a unit test framework. The policy engine reacting on Telepathy events is not yet implemented. The code will be available in the KDE SVN repository soon. Work-Package 2.3.2: Plugin API for connection managers The Telepathy community has developed these APIs and is actively maintaining them. They develop Connection Managers for a number of protocols (Jabber, VoIP, etc.). So far no CTI components are in the works. We bought a Snom VoIP telephone to investigate how we can jump start development in this area by providing a reference implementation. We expect that we will have to amend the Telepathy specification at this point for it to cover the requirements of CTI. Work-Package 4: Community Time was invested into providing a catalysator for Tapioca and Telepathy development, ultimately resulting in the close cooperation between the two team we see now. We did extensive testing for both frameworks, providing feedback wherever possible. At","title":"Decibel 2nd Project Report"},

Client side applications can be built on top of this interface by different groups. In addition, a simple GUI client will be developed as part of the project that will integrate the various P2P protocols. The first step is to examine the functionality present in current P2P systems. Some of the functionality is shared by many systems; other functionality is particular to just a few systems: Uploading files to a decentralised storage system. Searching for files. Clients can easily join or leave the network Chatting Particulars of client applications are also taken into account: Visual presentation of search results. Monitoring of the network and connectivity to the network. Based on these experiences, a programming interface will be derived that maps to each of the P2P protocols.

Also geographically, the project became broader then in the initial plans: participants from other Dutch speaking countries (Belgium and the Dutch Antilles) were joining in. Interest was expressed from France as well. CodeYard has become a synonym for innovative education. In this sense CodeYard can be seen as an incubator of Open Source in educational world. Participants use the materials provided by CodeYard, and add their project results on CodeYard platform. Besides, they are seen to actively help each other with realizing projects. To support these communications, the project team organised a number of meetings for the participants to meet.

Wedstrijd om beste IT-project enthousiasmeert scholieren. [Persbericht, Utrecht, 2 mei 2007] Op vrijdag 27 april jongstleden werd voor de tweede maal de Capgemini Open Source Award uitgereikt. De prijs werd toegekend aan Game Designer, een programma waarmee 2D spelletjes kunnen worden gemaakt zonder dat uitgebreide programmeerkennis vereist is. De makers van het programma, Nathan Samson (op de fot rechts) en Sam Heijens (links), zijn twee middelbare scholieren van het Koninklijk Lyceum in Antwerpen. (fotografie: Keke Keukelaar) De Capgemini Open Source Award is onderdeel van CodeYard, een initiatief van de Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen en Stichting NLnet, dat het voor middelbare scholieren mogelijk maakt te bouwen aan Open Source software. Doel van het project is middelbare scholieren te enthousiasmeren voor b&egrave;tastudies en de voordelen van Open Source software te promoten. Capgemini en de Radboud Universiteit deden begin dit jaar een oproep aan Nederlandse en Belgische middelbare scholieren om zelf Open Source software te ontwikkelen. Deze oproep resulteerde in vijftien kansrijke inzendingen, waarvan er --na verschillende voorrondes-- vijf doorgingen naar de finale. De vier runners-up, waren afkomstig van scholen in Doorn (Revius College), Geleen (Graaf Huyn College), Tilburg (Koning Willem II College) en Culemborg (ORS Lek en Linge) en ontwikkelden respectievelijk een digitale leeromgeving, een grafisch spel, een online game waarmee scholieren spelenderwijs kennis maken met Informatica en een webapplicatie om oudergesprekken op scholen in te roosteren. Het project Game Designer werd uitgeroepen tot de uiteindelijke winnaar. Het project onderscheidt zich volgens de jury door het hoogstaande technische niveau en de kenmerkende open source gedachte. Daarbij werd het project uitdagend genoemd en werden de goede presentatie, inzet en het cross platform karakter geroemd. \"Net als vorig jaar waren alle inzendingen van uitzonderlijke kwaliteit. Dit maakte de keuze erg moeilijk maar de jongens achter Game Designer blinken echt uit in project &eacute;n presentatie\", aldus juryvoorzitter Mario van Vliet, vice-president Capgemini en hoogleraar aan de Radboud Universiteit. De winnaars zelf, Sam Heijens en Nathan Samson geven aan \"heel blij\" te zijn met de prijs. \"We hoopten wel dat we zouden winnen maar het was spannend tot de laatste seconde.\" Met de geldprijs kopen de jongens een nieuwe laptop en een deel wordt waarschijnlijk geschonken aan een school in Nepal. Of Sam en Nathan zullen kiezen voor een studie Informatica is nog niet helemaal zeker, maar CodeYard wordt zeker gezien als een interessant project en goede stimulans. De winnaars van de Capgemini Open Source Award ontvingen de juryprijs ter waarde van 3.000&euro;. De publieksprijs ter waarde van 2.000&euro;, die dit jaar voor het eerst werd uitgereikt, ging naar het project Sokoban&nbsp;3D, ontwikkeld door Ben Ruyl van het Graaf Huyn College in Geleen.

CAcert services the Open Source digital certificate security needs of users across six continents Certificates issued by the nonprofit CA form the foundation for many server-side (web) and personal (email) security implementations. The organization enjoys international media attention for its policy of providing for free the very same types of certificates often sold by closed-source, commercial CAs (such as industry leaders Thawte and Verisign) for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars. Certificates While practical applications for the PGP/GPG infrastructure decline and the use of X.509 solutions increase in popularity, CAcert fills the gap between untrusted, self-signed (so-called \"home-brew\") certificates and their prohibitively expensive (commercial or governmental) counterparts. By enforcing the same stringent requirements for identity verification as other CAs, integrating this level of sophistication with the well-established community \"web\" trust model, and enabling its users to enhance their own trust status by seeking Assurance from qualified members of the trust community, CAcert has built a system that uses Open Source principles in the management and development of human, as well as software, elements. CAcert offers certificates for secure sockets layer, encrypted/authenticated email communications, wireless authentication, code signing, electronic document certification, client-server authentication, and more. Future products/services under consideration include an open, X-509-based alternative to Microsoft's proprietary \"Passport\" single log-in product, as well as various methodologies for integrating certificates with commodity token/smart-card products. Challenges Both developers and board members alike are resolved to tackling any and all obstacles that stand in the way of CAcert's stated goals. Current efforts include: the development of quality, user-friendly software to service a wide variety of user needs, concerns, and skill levels; the creation of standardized, public policies governing the use and support of certificates within the open source community; enhancing the existing Assurer base so that it can scale properly world-wide; continuing existing efforts to work with developers for purposes of gaining inclusion within certain products (e.g. Mozilla); and, increasing CAcert's user base and total number of certificates in circulation to provide additional leverage with future developers/OEMs."},

{"url":"/project/ambulant/description.html","description":"Ambulant; description [Ambulant Open SMIL Player -- concluded on 2007/12/31] The Ambulant Open SMIL 2.0 Player is an open-source implementation of the SMIL 2.0 standard. It is intended for researchers who need source-code access to a complete SMIL player environment. It may also be used as a stand-alone SMIL player for applications that do not need proprietary media formats. The player will support a range of SMIL 2.0 profiles, including desktop and mobile configurations based on specifications provided by the 3GPP Mobile Multimedia community. The player will be written in C++. Target implementations are for Linux and Windows implementations. A Mac OS-X implementation is also planned, depending on partner resources. The target community for the Ambulant Player are developers of multimedia protocols, networks and infrastructures. Since building new infrastructure components is difficult enough, nobody seems to have time to integrate their work in a standard player environment. We want to build a platform that will encourage the development of comparable multimedia research output. By providing what we expect will be a standard baseline player, other researchers and development organizations can concentrate on integrating extensions to the basic player (either in terms of new media codecs or new network control algorithms). Other researchers can then have access to both the baseline player and the extensions. We hope that this will help results verification, improve the quality of multimedia research and stimulate growth in the multimedia research marketplace. The Ambulant Player represents the first phase of a multi-year project aimed at improving network-level support for multimedia information processing.","title":"Ambulant; Description"},

The latter activities included W3C standardization meetings and follow-ups on comments made on the public Last Call Working Draft (LCWD), which was submitted for public comment in July. Reviewers within and outside W3C were asked to study the specification and to provide detailed comments. Approximately 70 comments on the LCWD were received from various reviewers. The LCWD is available at W3C SMIL. The W3C Structured Multimedia Working Group had a meeting in Amsterdam at CWI on September 20/21 [2007]. Hosted by the Ambulant team, all comments were discussed and each attributed with an initial response. Based on these results, the group decided to continue on its path to implementation. At present, four implementation groups have committed to working on the full or on parts of the of the SMIL 3.0 specification. It is projected that first implementation integration testing will occur in Boston, in November 2007 at the W3C Plenary meetings. The Ambulant team worked steadily to build new SMIL features into the Ambulant 1.09 code base. At present, most new SMIL 3.0 features have an initial implementation. The following new SMIL 3.0 features have been integrated into Ambulant 1.09: smilText: smilText got developed and tested on Mac OSX, Win32, WinMobile and Linux. It's our feeling that this will be core technology for SMIL; SMIL Media: support for opacity control was added. Initial support for media panning and zooming is also available; SMIL Layout: region-based opacity control got implemented; SMIL State: an initial integration of SMIL State with Python and XForms data models was implemented; Various test sets were made and will be donated to the SMIL testing infrastructure; Open-source cross-platform media support was added for all versions of Ambulant; This work will continue for the next three months. Additionally, Ambulant was integrated into various special-purpose projects, such as Passepartout, SPICE and BRICKS. This work was exceptionally well-received by the community. In order to increase the impact of the work done the team undertook the following activities: in June, meetings with two major North American telecommunication organizations, investigating possibilities to use SMIL within mobile and desktop environments; working with Daisy to integrate the AMIS/Ambulant code base; participating in academic activities in Canada (DocEng 2007); help organizing the workshop at ISM in Taiwan, due December 2007; and work with PUC-Rio on a new language which supports advanced interaction features. Worth to note that commercial third parties in Europe have selected Ambulant as the basis of their SMIL support in next-generation settop boxes (IBC in Amsterdam, September 2007). Plans for the near future: Completing the SMIL 3.0 specification; Development of new joint partnerships for the further development of Ambulant; and Travelling to relevant academic conferences and meetings."},

Gezien de complexiteit van de materie en enkele personele wijzigingen werd ook na februari 2003 doorgegaan met de werkzaamheden. Ook thans worden nog publicaties voorbereid die een uitvloeisel zijn van het project. Daarnaast lopen aanvragen voor verder onderzoek, waarvan enkele reeds zijn gehonoreerd. Verdere vervolgaanvragen worden nog ingediend. Dit rapport betreft de eerste fase van het ALIAS-onderzoek, dat werd gefinancierd door NLnet. Thans wordt het project onder de naam ALIAS, met dezelfde partners, voortgezet in verschillende deelprojecten. Onderwerp In het ALIAS-onderzoeksvoorstel werd gesteld dat: \"Wat nu ontstaat is een behoefte aan interactie tussen verschillende disciplines als Recht en AI om de 'digitalisering van alledag' te onderzoeken.\" Het uiteindelijke doel werd geformuleerd als: \"De juridische en maatschappelijke mogelijkheden en beperkingen verkennen van agenttechnologie met als uiteindelijk doel richtlijnen te ontwikkelen voor intelligente gedistribueerde agent systemen.\" Werkwijze In het onderzoeksvoorstel werd een vrij strak gedefinieerd onderzoeksplan aangegeven, gericht op de verschillende concepten die in het voorstel waren aangegeven, startend met de vraag wat is een agent en vervolgens de implicaties analyserend door het behandelen van de concepten mobiliteit, anonimiteit, traceerbaarheid en transacties. In deze blokken zou de nieuwe rol, en een nieuwe gezichtsveld m.b.t. deze concepten worden onderzocht. Gezien het interdisciplinaire karakter van het onderzoek, alsmede de betrokkenheid van drie verschillende onderzoeksgroepen was regelmatig overleg in plenaire zittingen noodzakelijk. Onderwerp waren, naast brainstorm over mogelijke juridische gevolgen en bespreking van voortgang en taakverdeling vooral ook de overeenstemming m.b.t. de concepten. Vooral in de eerste periode bleek nogal wat spraakverwarring te bestaan over de betekenis die aan verschillende concepten werd gegeven, vanuit het gezichtspunt van de verschillende disciplines. Het bleek dat de onderzoekers uit de verschillende disciplines een verschillend beeld hadden bij de concepten waarmee werd gewerkt. Dit had tot gevolg dat de planning ten opzichte van het oorspronkelijke voorstel moest worden bijgesteld, maar ook dat de werkwijze in het oorspronkelijke voorstel op de helling moest. Besloten werd een aantal scenario's vast te stellen die samen een overzicht moesten geven van de breedte van de problematiek en deze ook meer inzichtelijk dienden te maken. In de eerste tussenrapportages werd van deze situatie verslag gedaan. Overeenstemming werd bereikt met betrekking tot enkele basisconcepten die leidend voor het onderzoek werden. Met behulp van deze concepten werden de verschillende aandachtspunten vervolgens benaderd. Het ging daarbij om de concepten 'Autonomy', 'Identifiability and Traceability', 'Integrity and Originality' en 'Trust'. Vervolgens werd aan de hand van deze concepten het veld onderzocht en geanalyseerd. Ook de verslaglegging vond plaats aan de hand van deze concepten. Plenaire vergaderingen vonden plaats in maart, april juni, augustus, oktober, november, december 2001 en in januari, juni, augustus en december 2002. Tussendoor vonden besprekingen van subteams plaats. Naarmate de tijd vorderde werden de plenaire besprekingen minder belangrijk t.o.v. de subteam-besprekingen. Het aantal plenaire vergadering nam af. Schriftelijke tussenrapportages werden verzorgd in april 2001 en oktober 2001.

{"url":"/project/aha/description.html","description":"AHA!; description [Adaptive Hypermedia for All! -- concluded on 2003/07] The purpose of the AHA! project is to define, study and implement a facility for extending Web-servers with transparent, adaptive functionality. A Web-server is extended with a (servlet) module that registers users automatically, maintains a detailed user profile, and adapts the delivered information and the link structure based on that user profile. This server-side extension is generic, i.e. application independent, and open, meaning that the source of the information may itself be external to the server running the adaptive engine. More concretely, the AHA! project consists of two phases of one year each, with two people working in parallel. The funding of the second year shall depend on the outcome of the first year. The goals (research and development) of the two phases are: Phase 1: Design and development of a generic, open, adaptive engine, building on the initial AHA! prototype. The extensions include the ability to perform adaptation on documents from an external source, the ability to handle (and link to) composite objects, and better authoring support. Phase 2: Extending the design and implementation to allow richer user-models (with arbitrary attributes and value-domains), while maintaining desirable properties such as termination and confluence. A second extension will be the ability to define page constructors, i.e. ways to dynamically construct pages out of sets of information fragments. The authoring environment will also be extended to include support for these richer user models and page constructors. The research results will be published in national and international conferences and journals. The software will be published on the Internet and distributed as Open Source, using the GNU licensing scheme. After completion of the first phase, we shall start actively promoting the use of AHA! for applications in education, electronic commerce and corporate websites.","title":"AHA!; Description"},

It is available in \"almost final\" version, from the AHA! site a well as from SourceForge. Recent additions include authorization for authors. AHA! 3.0 is available as an early prerelease. Bart Berden and Barend de Lange are still ironing out some bugs. The work of Tomi Santic on \"the layout model\" (or \"page constructors\" as we used to call it) is being integrated into the 3.0 version. Two test applications for AHA! 3.0 are being constructed, one for a simulation of an electronic shop, by Peter Barna, and one for a simulation of different author and user personas for a museum guide, by Susanne Loeber. More presentations have been given on AHA!: Tomi Santic has presented the Layout Model work at the AH2003 workshop in Budapest, May 2003. Natasha Stash has presented the recent AHA! developments at the NLUUG Conference, Ede, May 2003. More presentations about AHA! have been scheduled: A talk about an AHA! application by Cristobal Romero is scheduled for the User Modeling Conference in Johnstown, PA, June 2003. A paper on AHA! will be presented at the PEG Conference (Powerful ICT Tools for Teaching and Learning) (Sint Petersburg, Russia, June 2003. A paper presentation about the AHA! versus Auld Linky work of Koen Aben will be given at the ACM Hypertext'03 conference in Nottingham, August 2003. A technical briefing about AHA! is also planned for this conference. Two presentations, one about the object inclusion and stable presentations (Barend de Lange and Bart Berden) and one about the Layout Model (Tomi Santic) have been accepted for the Elearn Conference in Phoenix, AZ, November 2003. Discussions with researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Hannover, Trinity College Dublin, and ENST, Brest, have lead to the setup of a discussion list on protocols for the exchange of information (domain and user model data) between different adaptive Web-based systems. Ideas from these discussions have already been incorporated in a new project proposal. The Adaptive Hypertext and Hypermedia Homepage has been made adaptive (but isn't online yet). This has enabled us to identify some shortcomings of AHA! for interactive applications with data entry by users and with the use of dates. Work on AHA! Version 2.0 and 3.0 will continue, and result in a \"final\" release of 2.0 and preliminary version(s) of 3.0. After June 30, the development of applications (courses) using AHA! 2.0 will start. AHA! 2.0 will be used as a \"production\" platform until AHA! 3.0 becomes stable enough.","title":"AHA! progress report, May 29, 2003"},

The current team at the TU/e consists of the following people: Natasha Stash is employed full-time by the AHA! project for the duration of the project. Brendan Rousseau is a junior researcher working on AHA! for 3 months. David Smits, Barend de Lange and Bart Berden are (full-time) thesis students at TU/e. Tomi Santic is a (full-time) thesis student working at the University of Pittsburgh. Progress (since previous report) up to this date The status of the AHA! project as of April 2, 2003 is described below. It lists the items that have been realized or worked on since the previous progress report. The AHA! 2.0 system has been released in \"beta\" version. All but one planned bug fixes and improvements for 2.0 have been implemented. The tutorial is being written (and almost ready). The authoring/administration environment has been improved: it now uses separate authorization for authors (so that not just anyone can start creating documents on an AHA! server). All conversion tools are fully functional (from authoring format to internal XML or mySQL format, and from XML to mySQL and back), including the translation of user models. A first test version of AHA! 3.0, with conditional object inclusion, stable presentations, and more presentation variations, is being used by Susanne Loeber to create an adaptive site (on Rembrandt). Tomi Santic is working on the inclusion of Interbook functionality into AHA!, with the ultimate goal of replacing Interbook by AHA!. A first paper about this work will be presented at the AH2003 workshop in Budapest, May 2003. Koen Aben has finished his internship work (done at the University of Southampton). He has developed a \"procedural adaptation language\" and is completing a compiler from that language to AHA! adaptation rules. A paper about this work will be presented at the ACM Hypertext'03 conference in Nottingham, August 2003. Future Milestones until June 30, 2003 Work on AHA! Version 2.0 and 3.0 will continue, and result in a \"final\" release of 2.0 and preliminary version(s) of 3.0. The tutorial being completed is the main test-case for this version. The AHA! 2.0 release is planned on or before May 1, 2003. Two students are working on a showcase: the Adaptive Hypertext and Hypermedia Homepage. Completion of this process depends partially on the availability of the new aha.win.tue.nl server (being installed now). Since the AH&amp;H Homepage is visited regularly by the whole adaptive hypermedia community, the whole community will get to experience AHA!. In the period until April 30, 2003, Barend de Lange and Bart Berden will write the main additions for AHA! 3.0: the integration of fragments in the concept structure and the creation of stable presentations. This will imply that the main document format will become XHTML (without any AHA!-specific tags). Barend and Bart will also develop a demo that uses SMIL instead of XHTML. A first prerelease of AHA! 3.0 is planned for May 1, 2003. David Smits has started his thesis work on the analysis of termination and confluence, and the inclusion of detection into the authoring tools. The work of Tomi Santic includes the presentation of abstract concepts and support for navigating between concepts and pages. This in effect implements page selectors. The work of Barend de Lange includes what we previously described as page constructors. Natasha Stash will work on improvements to the form editor and also write a multiple choice test editor that works in the same way. The period of May 1, 2003 to June 30, 2003 will be used to integrate the tools and the documentation, and to prepare the AHA! 3.0 release (the release will be after June 30 because bugs have to be worked out, but an alpha version should be available around May 1 and a beta around June 30).

It lists the items that have been realized or worked on since the previous progress report. AHA as previously ported to the Apache/Tomcat server version 3. (The current production version only works with Sun's JSWDK, a minimal server built on top of the Servlet runner.) The port is currently being updated for Tomcat version 4. This port is done by Paul De Bra. The upcoming production release of AHA will most likely use Tomcat version 4. A new data structure for concepts, with their requirements and with condition-action rules for user model updating has been designed (by David Smits, Davy Floes and Koen verheyen). An XML DTD for the external representation of this structure has been designed, that will be used in the upcoming release. A new core engine for AHA has been developed by David Smits. It works with the new data structure in which concepts have multiple attributes and condition-action rules. The upcoming release will feature the new core engine. In preparation of wider acceptance for AHA Natasha Stash has been investigating the use of modularized XML DTDs. The aim is to use pages that use a combined AHA and XHTML DTD. The result will be that plain XHTML pages can be augmented with AHA constructs (or not) and used with AHA this way. This makes it easier to include external documents. The results of this investigation are mixed: Modularized DTDs work with the most recent Xerces parser (included with Tomcat), so a combination of AHA with XHTML or SMIL is possible. Because the DTDs to be parsed are large, performance is not yet acceptable. It appears that the previous \"trick\" to hide all XML tags except for AHA tags will still be needed to achieve acceptable performance. Milestones Because of technical difficulties (broken computer) some work was shifted. (This has lead to the investigation of modularized DTDs instead of working on an intermediate release of AHA.) As a result, the planned release of AHA will be postponed until around April 1, 2002. The parts currently being worked on in the AHA project, and the new corresponding milestones, are as follows: The next AHA is planned for around April 1, 2002. It will include the following parts/features: Apache/Tomcat as well as JSWDK support. Complete installation instructions for both servers and for Linux as well as Windows 2000. New core engine with condition-action rules. New XML format for concepts/requirements/generate rules. Choice between file (XML) or database (mySQL). A combined editor for generate and requirement rules will be built, extending the requirement editor (completed by Jurgen van Westreenen on November 30, 2001). This task will be performed by Koen Verheyen (at UIA). The exact syntax for the rules has been determined (and illustrated with an example). The editor will be completed by May 31, 2002.

External documents may be in one of three formats: AHA XML format (just like local AHA pages); AHA HTML format (HTML mixed with AHA XML tags); HTML format There are some limitations with pages containing Images, Java Applets, or JavaScript code, but these are limitations with all possible filters that are HTTP servers and retrieve documents from other HTTP servers. A Java Applet based editor for \"requirement rules\" has been created. Database support has been added for the mySQL database system. Through a simple switch the main files for adaptation (requirement list, generate list) and all user models can be stored either as XML files or as database tables. The concept structure has been changed so that user-model concepts can now have multiple attributes. This change has been incorporated in the requirements editor and the database support, but not yet in the main engine. (As a result it cannot yet be fully used.) Future Milestones The parts currently being worked on in the AHA project, and the corresponding milestones, are as follows: The Apache support, unified page DTD, anonymous login, external document loading and mySQL database support will be integrated into a single code base. This task will be performed by Natasha Stash and completed by January 15, 2002. The core engine will be extended with support for concepts with multiple attributes. This task will be performed by David Smits and completed by February 28, 2002. (This is also the end-date of his internship.) Based on the work described above, a new release of AHA will be published on the AHA website on March 1, 2002. A combined editor for generate and requirement rules will be built, extending the requirement editor (completed on November 30, 2001). This task will be performed by Koen Verheyen. A first partial prototype of this editor (perhaps not yet \"connected\" to the AHA engine) will be completed by February 28, 2002, and the \"final\" editor will be completed by May 31, 2002. The current modules for multiple-choice tests, user-model updates and preferences, will be integrated and extended to form a general-purpose forms interface. This task will be performed by Davy Floes. The design of this interface (definition of the types of forms,","title":"AHA! progress report December 4, 2001"},

There is still a problem with the second junior researcher, Olga Proskura, who will commence work when passport and visa issues will be settled. In the mean time two students from TU/e have started working on the project and as of October 5, two students from the University of Antwerp (UIA) will also start working on the project. The TU/e students will be working on AHA for 3 months, the UIA students for 9 months. Activities and results The current division of tasks among the AHA project team members is the following: Natasha Stash is working on the issue of enabling the AHA system to retrieve documents from external sources. The actual retrieval of external documents has been implemented. Natasha is now working on the issue of filtering documents so that external HTML or HTML+AHA documents can be translated to AHA documents upon retrieval, and then parsed by the AHA engine. Jurgen van Westreenen is designing a user-interface (editor) for entering and modifying requirements that guide the adaptation. Such requirements represent dependencies or rules for reading order between pages or between pages and concepts. Jurgen's internship also includes implementation of this interface. David Smits is designing the coupling of the AHA engine with the mySQL database. At the same time he is including features for representing multiple attributes per concept. David's internship also includes implementation of the database coupling. The two students in Antwerp: Koen Verheyen and Davy Floes will commence work shortly. It is still open which of the parts of the AHA projects they are going to tackle. Meanwhile some small projects are still going on or nearing completion. These include making AHA work with the Apache/Tomcat server and the integration of the DTD for pages with the one for headers and footers. A Web address has been allocated for the AHA project. The first PR activity of the AHA project will be the creation of this website and the inclusion of the most recent \"production\" version of AHA and its tutorial. The address is http://aha.win.tue.nl/ ."},
{"url":"/project/agfl/under-gnu.html","description":"Why AGFL under a GNU licence AGFL is a typical solution in search of a problem: when given a grammar and its associated lexicon covering some natural language like english, it is easy to generate an efficient parser for that language, but very few applications demand such a parser because such parsers are a rarity: linguists are traditionally more concerned with giving an abstract \"account\" of language than with doing the painstaking work to describe a particular language in a more or less complete and consistent way most NLP projects set out to produce a parser intended for some particular purpose, rather than a grammar to be used for many different purposes most parsers are written in some programming language for efficiency, so that the knowledge contained in them is buried in code and there is no collaborative improvement of existing parsers others are written in some proprietary formalism and jealously hidden from the eyes of the non-initiated commercial users are deterred from using parsers already developed elsewhere by unpredictable financial demands and the absence of maintenance since there is no demand for such parsers, there is little or no supply. In order to break this stalemate, the AGFL project has brought the AGFL system in the public domain: AGFL is provided as a common formalism to be used freely by any linguist, guaranteeing the automatic generation of efficient parsers the system comes with a number of grammars and lexica for free, in particular the EP4IR (English Phrases for Information Retrieval) grammar of English anybody is invited to use the AGFL system and the accompanying EP4IR grammar and lexicon of English for whatever purpose he likes, including commercial purposes, as long as the GPL is adhered to anybody can make and share his improvements to the free grammars and lexica, or add new ones in the same spirit.","title":"Why AGFL under a GNU licence"},

{"url":"/project/a-a-p/200303-progress.html","description":"Progress report March 2003 Agide Agide 0.1 has been released March 13. This was almost a week later as planned, but with all the functionality that was intended. Not bad at all. The web site has been updated to show that the A-A-P project now consists of two main parts: Aap, the recipe executive, and Agide, the A-A-P GUI IDE. A tutorial for Agide has been added. The agide.org domain has been claimed, www.agide.org now points to the A-A-P website. This will strengthen the name Agide. Searching for \"Agide\" on Google currently results in a fifth place, still rising. A bit of help was received from Gordon Prieur of Sun to enhance the Netbeans interface (this forms the connection between Agide and Vim). Daniel Elstner helped implementing balloon evaluation for GTK Vim. This certainly helped making the 0.1 release include nice features, such as showing the value of a variable in a balloon by pointing to it with the mouse. Unfortunately, the number of reactions about Agide has been disappointing so far. Not much more than a few people have mentioned that they started using it. This will require finding out a way to attract more users, and especially people who would like to enhance Agide. I suspect people hesitate to install wxPython, but it is not clear that this is the threshold that keeps people from using Agide. There is one known issue still to be solved: When starting the debugger the gvim window must be closed, otherwise Agide will hang. This looks like a problem with wxPython and threads, it is not clear how to fix this properly. Aap After the Agide release work was conentrated on issues with Aap, the recipe executive. In the past months several remarks have been made by users and there have been discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of the current choices. These issues need to be taken care of before the Aap 1.0 release. The big issue taken care of is scope of variables. The old solution with \":export\" and \":global\" commands didn't work well. After a long discussion on the maillist a choice was made to use scope names in the form \"scope.var\". This has been implemented and is working well. The recipe becomes simpler to understand, while the use of variables like $CFLAGS still works as expected. One disadvantage that has been encountered during implementation is that using a variable name without a scope name in a Python command doesn't search other scopes. That is because the Python \"exec\" command cannot be used with a custom dictionary. But otherwise it works well and several parts of the implementation actually became simpler and more efficient (no longer need to copy a dictionary for each block of build commands). A problem has been encountered with Python, while executing the recipe that applies over 400 patches to Vim: A block of commands in an \"if\" statement cannot exceed 32000 bytes of bytecode. This has been reported and Guido admits this is a Python problem. Fortunately it was possible to avoid the \"if\" statement, the recipe now works without trouble. Presentation The A-A-P presentation for the O'Reilly conference has been accepted. This is in the second week of July. This would be a perfect opportunity to announce the release of Aap 1.0, which was scheduled for July. This does require doing it a bit quicker than originally planned, which means some less important work needs to be shifted to the 1.1 release. Progress One week more than planned was spend on Agide. It looks like the work to make Aap ready for the 1.0 release is going to be a bit more than expected. The implementation of scopes took over a week, and there are several other issues still to be done. Let's say this will take one more week than planned, thus we lag behind schedule about two weeks. Coming Weeks With only three months to go until the planned Aap 1.0 release, the remaining work consists mostly of smaller work packages. More work to be done and trying to get it ready before the O'Reilly conference requires shifting some work to","title":"Progress report March 2003"},

NLnet is a small but very active technology fund with a global scope, providing developtment grants to disruptive as well as fundamental technology projects that help make the internet safer and more trustworthy. Gauw brings along over 17 years of experience in the internet community. For the last six years he served as Commercial Director of NLix, which during this time became the fifth largest internet exchange on the planet. Before that he was chairman of the board of the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. Gauw is looking forward to his new position. \"Certainly over the course of the last year sinister matters have come to light that alter our perspective on the current health status of the internet\", he remarks. \"Safety and privacy of users turn out to be protected far less well than often assumed. NLnet has been working for over twenty years - underneath the radar of public attention - on maintaining the open and federated internet as we all originally envisioned. Its work is more necessary than ever, and the time has come to move to into the center and try to bring together the necessary means.\" The history of NLnet goes back to 1982 when the first pan-European UNIX network was announced by internet pioneer and subsequent director of NLnet Teus Hagen. Hagen was inaugurated last year into the Internet Hall of Fame by the international Internet Society for his contributions.

{"url":"/news/2013/20130701-awards.html","title":"Awarded projects","description":"Awarded projects The selected projects within the June 2013 Call are: Sockethub Sockethub is a polyglot (speaking many different protocols and APIs) messaging service for social and other interactive messaging applications. It assists web app developers by providing server-independent, server-side functionality - which gives the application greater autonomy. It can be used as a tool for many different types of applications, large and small. Sockethub virtually allows everybody talk to everybody. Lead developer is Nick Jennings (Czech Republic). More about Sockethub Hoodie Hoodie is - like the Unhosted project that has also received funding by NLnet - part of the noBackend movement. noBackend is about building data-driven apps without a smart backend. It enables frontend developers to do common backend tasks by themselves, like user authentication, sending emails, or payments. Hoodie is one of the major open source contenders in this area - an extensible web application development framework written in Javascript with the distinct goal of making full-stack application accessible and easy to front-end developers and designers. Like Ruby on Rails did for backend development, Hoodie tries to solve many if not all of the mundane things every application needs, so developers can focus on what's unique to their apps. Hoodie is a front-end, in-browser JavaScript API that is designed from application backwards to the backend that powers it. For every (even moderately sophisticated) application developers need to worry about building and running a backend service somewhere. That means system administration, server provisioning, cluster configuration - not even mentioning the security aspects of doing this without too much background. Hoodie is designed to take this very generic work out of the hands of developers, and do a better job in the background while unburdening the developers. The funding from NLnet is used amongst other to make Hoodie fully modular, and then make it extensible with plugins. Global Directories The Global Directories project (part of InternetWide.org ) wants to solve the problem of maintenance of ones social graph while keeping the nature of relationships private among the people involved - and while at it create an exciting new mechanism to discover new services and lower the threshold of communication security. People change jobs, start using other social networks and pick up new devices and services every day - and you are expected to keep up with these divergent online activities of dozens or even hundreds of people in your network. In order to lower the workload, people typically register themselves on one of a few centralised services, and then ask everyone they know to join them there as well. Sometimes this involves sharing their whole address book with some intransparent commercial entity that is prepared to suck up this information in return for the right to later sell it to whomever they like for whatever purpose they like. Often this involves sending out mass unsolicited mails to every contact in ones address book ( X wants to add you to their network. Click here... ). And this happens over and over again. On the internet, that is not how it has to be. Distribution of information is easy and cheap, and information can be subscribed to at the source. Global Directories will allow everybody that wants some or all information about themselves or their company to be automatically retrievable by others to run a fully distributed directory service. That sounds more difficult than it is, it just means the user publishes their business card themselves and retains full control over what the contacts interested in them can see on that at all times. If someone wants to find some information about user@example.com, all they need to do is ask the directory service at example.com for the card - which means that there is not need for untrustedthirdparty.com. The information in such a directory is highly structured"},

{"url":"/news/2012/20120521-awards.html","description":"Awards The winners of the April 2012 calls are: OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC Even though email as an internet application is nearly four decades old, it is perhaps still the single most universal communication technology in use today. Its open architecture exemplifies the core characteristics of the open and distributed internet, which of course also makes it vulnerable to abuse. There are a number of more modern technologies that can help reduce the most common forms of abuse by spammers, phishers and identity thieves, such as DKIM (see RFC6376) and SPF (RFC 4408). The common idea behind both is to give the receiving mail server some simple technical means to cryptographically validate the origins of incoming email, instead of using ad hoc, error-prone stochastic or rule-based filtering or burdening users. However, in order for these technologies to replace the current ad hoc spam processing and filtering solutions there needs to be a critical deployment base, which won't happen without more significant adoption. The project will help in breaking this circular dependency by solving a couple of long-standing operational, deployment, and reporting issues related to email authentication protocols. OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC are two projects that will help bootstrap this natural evolution of email. OpenDKIM provides an SDK for adding DKIM to applications, and a filter that makes use of the SDK to provide filtering services to MTAs. DKIM provides a reliable domain name on email messages, but could also with some modification be used on web pages, Usenet articles, or other objects of similar format. OpenDKIM includes DNSSEC support, and is in production use at Yahoo and AOL, among others. OpenDMARC will be an open source DMARC implementation, with the intent to have it be the reference implementation. NLnet supports both projects as well as ongoing research and development of domain-based reputation systems that rely on DKIM, which in turn relies on secure DNS use to advertise keys and policies. More about: OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC. UmTRX This project is a part of a bigger effort to create a completely open GSM network previously supported by NLnet, from a low level hardware to high level software. We're aiming at introducing open-source into the telecom industry, one of the most closed industries with ubiquitous influence on our lives. The project builds open hardware which is designed specifically to work with OpenBTS and OsmoBTS/OpenBSC open-source projects. While those software projects enjoy quick growth, the hardware side has been remaining proprietary. UmTRX will be the first open hardware to work within the core telecom networks. UmTRX hardware is based on USRP N2x0 design with ADC, DAC and analog frontend replaced with LMS6002D single-chip transceiver to provide better cost efficiency. UmTRX supports 2TRX with diversity receive by utilizing two Tx/Rx channels (each with a single LMS6002D) connected to a single FPGA. Diversity receive is an important option to provide a consistent coverage in complex terrain landscapes. UmTRX has a 26MHz clock synchronized to GPS, which is a requirement to provide reliable network connection. Aside from hardware development, the project includes implementation of GPRS, multi-ARFCN and handover support for OpenBTS, (funded by New America Foundation OTI), OpenBTS and OpenBSC integration (funded by BJT Partners), etc. More about: UmTRX Meemoo framework When you think of an \"app\", do you think of something that you can open, hack, and change how it works? The Meemoo framework works by dragging and dropping open-source modules, giving non-programmers the freedom to create, remix and extend cross-platform apps, and learn how they work. The way that the data flows from module to module is defined and visualized by colorful wires. If you can connect a video player to a TV, you can program a Meemoo app. It all happens on the web using real web technologies, so it is as trivial to see, copying and/or modifying","title":"Awards"},

The Foundation wants to bridge the digital divide of privacy between corporations and governments moving to adopt tools allowing fully encrypted communication while private individuals are left without protection. Once safer technologies are available consumers will be able to successfully use them and demand them from service providers. \"Controlling who can reach you and who has access to your communication has been a weak point of mainstream internet communication,\" states NLnet's strategy manager Michiel Leenaars, pointing to both the dominance of players like Skype, MSN and AOL on the one hand as well as the enormous growth of `lawful intercept' activities around the world. \"It's like not owning your own doorbel, and at the same time being broadcasted live over the radio with every single conversation you have. That is not going to work --not in private life, but surely also not in business.\" NLnet's activities are backed up by a significant trust fund that was created at the sale of the first ISP in the Netherlands a decade ago. Since then, the foundation has spent a vast amount of money on open standards, open source and community building. The foundation believes that with the convergence of all modern communication technologies towards the internet there is a window of opportunity to break into the market and recapture some of the privacy that was lost in recent years. \"Confidentiality is not a crime, it is a basic element of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" says Leenaars. \"Especially in repressive political systems, but also in democracies under threat of irresponsible anti-terrorism measurements --like the European data retention directive -- we need technological guarantees to ensure that the private domain is again separated from the public domain and from commercial misuse.\" For 2008, the focus in this area will be on safe, trustworthy and robust realtime presence and session technology as an enabler for privacy. The foundation will focus on technology development as well as creating awareness, and will be actively pursuing the further enhancement of online privacy and standardisation in internet based communication and presence tools such as voice, chat and videoconferencing. The foundation has already started funding work on open source implementation of internet standards such as SIP/SIMPLE and MSRP through its open calls, but will increase its activities after this recent board decision.","title":"Theme: Identity, privacy &amp; presence"},

That means it will spend a significant amount of its 2008 annual budget on the development of (open source) ODF tools, community building and contributing to the standards development process of the upcoming ODF 1.2 version. ODF is a broadly supported ISO-standard ( get it here ) for Office formats that is the successor to corporate-owned file formats such as .doc, .wpd and .xls. It is fast becoming the default file format of choice for text editors, spreadsheets and other office applications within governments, businesses and for personal use. \"Open Document Format is making it possible to store the majority of information we use every day in a future proof and innovation-friendly format,\" says Michiel Leenaars, strategy manager at NLnet. \"We see a vast demand and bright future for ODF, especially now Microsoft has started abandoning its old file formats without a decent stable alternative.\" The Foundation believes that 2008 will see the mass breakthrough of ODF. \"There is so much momentum. ODF is truly disruptive technology in disguise,\" states Leenaars. \"It will turn the world of computers as we know it upside down completely; that is why we will be there to support the general interest with our investments\". The Foundation has already started work on an ODF tool to collaborate on a single document with potentially thousands of people at the same time. NLnet was one of the founding members of the recently started OpenDoc Society, a global not-for-profit member based organisation uniting consumers, technologists, entrepreneurs and policy makers around the globe. Recently, NLnet joined ECMA TC45 to ensure proper interoperability of Microsoft's proposed re-archiving standard OOXML with the global information standard ODF.","title":"Theme: Open Document Format"},

The project was started because most available maps seem to be free, but actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways. The Dutch subsidiary of OpenStreetMap receives a donation for further development of their software needed to for 1) backups, roll-back possibilities, signalling changes and the assigning of trust levels to the maps; 2) a light-weight mobile editor to be developed to change the OpenStreetMap data ‘in the field’; 3) development of a convenient interface for transmitting changes while working in the field. The Ambulant Open SMIL Player is an ongoing project, intended for researchers who need source-code access to a complete SMIL player environment. It can also be used as a stand-alone SMIL player for applications which do not require proprietary media formats. The project receives a donation for further dissemination of the achieved project results, i.e. for travel-related costs and incidental equipment for showcasing Ambulant on a host of mobile and emerging devices. The OpenDocument Translation Converter project aims on easy translation and localisation of traditional word processing content through converting OpenDocument format texts into Gettext PO and the emerging standard XLIFF. It will solve one of the primary problems with the translation of content --difficulty to divorce the translator from the layout and from the tools that created the content. The outputs of this project will help to advance the promotion of open standards and the translation of content in office documents. GGZ Gaming Zone is a free platform for on-line gaming. The GGZ project has nearly 8 years by now, and persuaded other projects to use GGZ. Major users include some KDE and GNOME on-line games, as well as individual game projects like Freeciv. GGZ will receive a contribution to host a dedicated server for the development of the platform.

It should ease Open Source project development and deployment. The work started in March 2002 and the first phase will end in May 2003. This project involves a total of 1.2 man-years for the first phase. AHA! Phase 2 The Adaptive Hypermedia for All! work started with a feasibility phase in July 2001 that ended in June 2002. This first phase involved an implementation effort of nearly 2 man-years. The AHA! phase&nbsp;2 project is the successor of the phase&nbsp;1 work and involves better user modelling and improved adaptation possibilities. This second phase will end in July 2003. It involves 1 man-year of work, along with the work done by five MSc students. Release 2.0 is expected to appear in April 2003. The phase&nbsp;2 implementation work should be completed in July 2003, resulting in Release 3.0. Atom-Based Routing The Atom-Based Routing project will develop or adapt a routing protocol (e.g. BGP) that makes use of atoms in order to achieve a protocol of lower complexity for routing Internet traffic. The work started in October 2002 and should end in November 2003. The work is done in cooperation with CAIDA and RIPE NCC and involves 1.6 man-years. One man-year is subsidized via NLnet Labs. CP2PC The CP2PC project, started in February 2002, consisted of two phases: a feasibility study of integrating a client into Peer-to-Peer networks, and the implementation of such a client to initially support GDN (a result of NLnet's SIRS project) and Gnutella. It involved about 0.9 man-year total for the pilot phase. The project was planned to end in December 2002. Results are expected in the","title":"Stiching NLnet Annual report 2002"},

{"title":"Zimbu Awards presented","url":"/project/a-a-p/20031008-awards.html","description":"Zimbu Awards presented Nijmegen, Netherlands, October 8, 2003. An unusual occasion in the world of open-source software: A prize for the best contribution to a project. Many software developers work on freely distributable computer programs without compensation. Thus it does not provide them with money and the work must be done next to a job or studies. An expression of appreciation for the work done is appropriate. Mostly this appreciation only consists of an informal \"thank you\" from users. For the A-A-P project we wanted to do more than that and the contest for the Zimbu Awards was put in place. Zimbu is the A-A-P mascot. The three Zimbu Award winners are: Adriaan de Groot receives the 444 euro award for \"the best contribution to the A-A-P project\". He has tracked down a large number of problems and provided solutions. He changed the documentation from SGML to XML and wrote an explanation about how to get the required tools for XML. Adriaan added support for \"libtool\", helped implementing language modules and improved the robustness of several commands. Rui Lopes receives the 222 euro award for \"the most useful patch for Aap or Agide\". Rui made the FreeBSD port of Aap and supplied patches to make installing Aap work a lot better. The quality of his patches was remarkably high. By making the FreeBSD port he also increased the visibility of the A-A-P project. J&ouml;rg Beyer receives the 111 euro award for \"the brightest idea for the A-A-P project\". J&ouml;rg has supplied several solutions for tricky problems in the Aap implementation. The scope support was based on his ideas, he made a first implementation for the automatic configuration support and improved the setup for testing. Strangely, not much of his code ended up in Aap, but his suggestions were indispensible. J&ouml;rg donates his prize to the ICCF Holland Foundation, to help needy children in Uganda. Adriaan de Groot, the winner of the main prize, was pleasantly surprised with the award being presented to him in person. It happens to be that the winner works not far from where the A-A-P project leader lives. Everybody in the world had an equal oppurtunity to get the prize. Adriaan has clearly given the largest contribution to the project. Bram Moolenaar, the A-A-P project leader, assures that the distance was of no importance when selecting the winner. More pictures of the award presentation. When asked whether the chance to win a Zimbu Award has motivated him to work on A-A-P Adriaan replies this was indeed so. He has a limited amount of time available and a lot of plans. Nevertheless, his appreciation for the capabilities of Aap also played an important role. He expects that Aap will make building KDE applications a lot simpler. Adriaan intends to keep working on this the coming months, thus he certainly deserves the Zimbu Award. Obviously, the development of Aap and Agide continues. Despite the passing of the deadline for the Zimbu Awards the A-A-P maillist is busy with discussions about further improvements. We are thankful that many developers are willing to spend time on improving open-source software without getting a prize. The prizes have been made available by Stichting NLnet, the organisation that also funded the setup of the A-A-P project. There may be some confusion about the names. A short explanation: A-A-P The name of the project. It is not an abbreviation, it was selected because the \"a-a-p.org\" domain was available and sorts nicely. Aap Name of the major program in the A-A-P project. Aap executes recipes, which are files that describe work to be done. It can be compared to \"make\", but is more robust, portable and has many more features. Agide Another program of the A-A-P project. It stands for \"A-A-P GUI IDE\". It is a flexible software development platform. Zimbu The A-A-P mascot. Aap is the Dutch word for monkey. For questions: Bram Moolenaar"},
{"title":"VirtNet Progress Report","description":"VirtNet Progress Report In the previous months, a prototype kernel-level virtualization framework for FreeBSD-CURRENT was developed, allowing the previously global kernel state to be instantiated and operated on in multiple independent copies. This prototype is a reasonably stable and functional; it demonstrates the abilities of a sligtly modernized virtualization methodology and framework. The prototype was recently tested in a possible Internet router-like setup, where it was subjected to a full-view live BGP feed with forced peering flapping. The virtualized kernel endured this challenge for several days, with no observable issues. A systematic performance evaluation of the new prototype has yet to be performed, however, a few preliminary tests --such as for loopback TCP throughput-- show that the virtualization overhead is not measurable; both the standard and the virtualized network stack yield exactly the same throughput levels. Further progress was made in the PF firewall and NFS virtualization, as well as in improved housekeeping of virtual network stack instances. The protoype is kept in sync with the developments in FreeBSD-CURRENT, giving the ability of using the virtualized kernel as a snap-in replacement for the stock kernel, without any modifications to userspace libraries or tools. This sould attract a broader test audience.","url":"/project/virtnet/20070720-report.html"},

{"title":"TimeWalker; Description","description":"TimeWalker; description [TimeWalker implementation project -- concluded on 2002/10/31] The goal of this project is to implement a tool for visualising huge amounts of log data. The visualisation techniques of TimeWalker are based on the paradigm of information visualisation. In this paradigm, the emphasis is on maximizing information density and minimizing end-user effort by always showing detail and context simultaneously. TimeWalker introduces the innovative concept of an hierarchical zoom lens sliding along the time-axis. Because the user-interface is exploiting the typical human capabilities for pattern-recognition, TimeWalker can be seen as a sophisticated looking-glass for visual data-mining in the time-dimension. In order to optimize usability, there will be close cooperation from the beginning with alpha- and beta-sites. Network and system maintenance is chosen as the first application-domain. Feedback will be based on sites that are representative for producing high volumes of log data within distributed infrastructures. TimeWalker is also quite interesting as an open-source project exploiting Python up to its limits as a wide-spectrum language in any stage in the software lifecycle. Python has enabled a high level of elegance and portability to represent implementation, documentation, persistent storage of data and running states, regression tests and profiling. A remarkable scalability and performance could be obtained by just using the generic facilities of Numerical Python and wxPython, instead of coding specfic extensions in C.","url":"/project/timewalker/description.html"},

In het afgelopen schooljaar deelde de stichting ruim een ton aan subsidies uit voor projecten van in totaal 10 scholen. Vanaf vandaag kunnen scholen uit het primair en voortgezet onderwijs voor het schooljaar 2007/2008 een aanvraag indienen voor subsidie voor een (ICT)project dat innovatief is in onderwijskundig opzicht en leidt tot verrijking, verandering, vernieuwing of verbreding van het onderwijs. Stichting TQ-NL is voortgekomen uit Stichting ThinkQuest Nederland, de organisatie die van 1999 tot 2002 de zeer succesvolle ThinkQuest web-strijden heeft georganiseerd. Doelstelling van de stichting is het stimuleren van innovatieve Internet-activiteiten en –initiatieven die het Nederlandse onderwijs ten goede komen. Daarvoor stelt de Stichting 3 jaar lang subsidies beschikbaar voor innovatieve onderwijsprojecten. Stichting TQ-NL wil in de te subsidi&euml;ren projecten de leerling een belangrijke rol laten spelen. Niet alleen door de rol van de leerling binnen de projecten als criterium voor toekenning van subsidie te nemen, maar ook door groepjes leerlingen te vragen om de ingediende projecten op aantrekkelijkheid te beoordelen. Op basis van deze oordelen beslist het bestuur van Stichting TQ-NL welke idee&euml;n nader uitgewerkt kunnen worden om in aanmerking te komen voor subsidie. De projecten in deze tweede subsidieronde moeten worden uitgevoerd in het schooljaar 2007-2008. In de aanvragen moet innovatief gebruik van ICT om het onderwijs te vernieuwen centraal staan, bijv. gegevensuitwisseling via het Internet of een andere manier, zoals met GPS of mobiele telefonie. Of bijv. door taalzwakke leerlingen te stimuleren in hun taalontwikkeling met behulp van video-conferencing, digitale prentenboeken en i-pods. Dat op basis van recente didactische inzichten. Subsidie-aanvraag voor middelen (hard- en software) is binnen de totaalbegroting met mate toegestaan, mits de aanschaf relevant is voor het bereiken van de projectdoelen: onderwijsvernieuwing met behulp van ICT. De stichting geeft de voorkeur aan kleinschalige projecten. Per project wordt in principe maximaal &euro;12.500,- subsidie ter beschikking gesteld. Aanvragen voor de subsidieronde 2006/2007 kunnen worden ingediend tot uiterlijk 29 december 2006, 12.00 uur, via het aanvraagformulier. Een contactformulier biedt de mogelijkheid vragen te stellen aan de organisatie over dit initiatief."},

Both work on different areas of Parrot. Chip Salzenberg Chip is working on milestone 1: the design document milestone. The deliverables for this milestone are the Parrot design documents (PDDs). In this period, Chip has completed the overall roadmap for the design documents (PDD&nbsp;0), the lexical variables design document (PDD&nbsp;20), and the calling conventions design document (PDD&nbsp;3). In addition, Chip is responsible for ongoing design decisions on the mailing lists and over IRC, and architectural and code review on major contributions to Parrot. Leopold T&ouml;tsch Leo is working on milestone 2: the stub implementation milestone. Leo's responsibilities also include ongoing bug fixes and implementation of new features for Parrot. He released Parrot 0.3.0 on October 1st. The most significant feature of this release is the implementation of the new calling conventions. He released Parrot 0.3.1 on November 6th. The most significant feature of this release is the completion of variable-sized register frames. This feature represents months of work by Leo and is an important step forward in flexibility and stability for Parrot. Among other things, moving to variable-sized register frames fixed a significant long-term bug in Parrot with continuation-based control flow. (See Leo's journal for details.) Leo plans to release Parrot 0.4.0 over the Dec 3rd-4th weekend. For this release he implemented lexical handling according to PDD20, and updated the Parrot tests for the new lexical handling. He also helped the developers of the TCL and Amber compilers on Parrot to use the new lexical syntax (both are working fine with it). Also included in this release will be his implementation of argument passing to exception handlers (TCL already works with it). Leo has submitted a proposal for a Parrot talk to SANE 2006 ."},

SeRQL ( Sesame RDF Query Language, pronounced circle ) is a new RDF query language that is currently being developed by Aidministrator. Its aim is to combine the best features of several other (query) languages (RQL, RDQL, N-Triples, N3) and address several practical issues that Sesame users experienced using existing languages. One of its main characteristics is its ability to return a transformed RDF graph as a result, instead of just a table with values, like most other RDF query languages do. Currently, SeRQL is purely an RDF query language. Unlike RQL, it does not have any RDF Schema specific functionality yet.

Children and teachers can get access to e-mail and websites with minimal effort. The systems are pre-configured to fit best in the school environment. The SchoolLan system is based on an off the shelf PC Linux server, serving its Windows clients, targeted for small-scale educational environments (50-75 computers per school, or several cooperating schools situated close together). SchoolLan has been designed and configured to allow remote technical management within a (technically naive) school environment. SchoolLan also provides system/network administration applications which enable the school staff to install (Window) clients, maintain student accounts and working environments and use third party educational software from the server. SchoolLan is a blueprint for a technical configuration/network model: its Open Source (GPL) design and configuration can easily be duplicated by primary schools elsewhere. Implementation The technical core of SchoolLan is a network environment with a central Linux server, serving a heterogenous collection of Windows based clients. The clients can be (re)installed very easily with a preconfigured Windows OS (originally via BpBatch software and scripts, but nowadays via a PXE Linux bootstrapping mechanism). Networking services consist of (a.o.) Samba for Microsoft Networking, Sendmail for e-mail services, DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation, IPtables for hiding and protecting the intranet, BIND&nbsp;V9 for internal name service, Apache and webfiltering tools for internal and external web access, GipLan for student account management and educational software package management, etc. There is a template system for incorporating Windows based educational packages into the system. An extensive backup and archiving system is provided to ease the unattended backups. Stichting SchoolLan The foundation \"Stichting SchoolLan\" aims at stimulating the development and deployment of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in an Open Source fashion for (primary) schools. The foundation is setting up the \"SchoolLan Platform\" as a group of cooperating companies and users to continue the support and development of the SchoolLan software. The operation is on a non-profit basis."},

{"title":"Project Status, March-June 2007","description":"Project Status, March-June 2007 [by Mark Overmeer, 2007-07-06] NLnet's contribution to the CPAN6 project is planned to span a year. This progress report covers a first time-frame: the first of March up to the end of June: four months. The project plan lists a progress report after the first two month, but for various reasons this was not feasible; mainly because it was impossible to allocate sufficient time to complete the programming tasks. NLnet's participation in the CPAN6 development has two faces, which will be discussed separately: prolonged support for promotional activities partial development support 1. Promotional activities The promotional work is targeted on future user groups. In this case, the effect of the project is indirect: CPAN6 is an infrastructure which can be used to as an open/save button in nearly any application. So, the application developers must be convinced to include the connection with CPAN, which is probably more difficult than convincing end-users. One of the first targeted communities is that of the Perl developers, which can use CPAN6 to distribute the products of their new language version ( Perl6 ) and Parrot. Presentations about CPAN6 were given during the Dutch and German Perl Workshops (resp Feb and March), and two talks during the monthly well-visited Perl Mongers meeting of Amsterdam.pm. Chosen is to avoid too many presentations on the core of CPAN6 to the Perl community, but to focus on general purpose modules which are create as side-products for this project. This reduces the chance that people get overfed with the same story, over and over again. During the German Perl Workshop, extensive debates took place with the designer and maintainer of Perl's popular CPAN, with a focus the probable reasons for this archives popularity. During the Perl Hackathon in Arnhem in March, two days were spent to discuss and explore various interface techniques. For NLnet, a plan for promotion was produced. An overview of CPAN6 features was presented during a little frequented day organized by the Dutch Linux user community ( NLLGG ). In total, three new CPAN6 related presentations were added to the two existing. This adds up to about seven hours of material for various audiences. On the moment, only a small symbolic sponsoring form the German Perl Mongers was collected as additional support. Negotiations with Atos are under way, but delayed for personal reasons on their side; they may contribute in validating the XML schemas. The CPAN6 project will be completed on own expense, if there are no additional fundings. Next to financial contributions, people are sought to help improve the software directly. To achieve this, the software has been split in various large, general purpose components. Each of the released components has a few users and contributors now. This will improve the code quality before it gets integrated as CPAN6. 2. Implementation On the software side, major steps were taken to create some crucial building bricks. The infrastructure will be pluggable, which means that at least the interconnections and one example implementation for each pluggable interface must be realized. As example graphical front-end, the choice was made for an Web2.0/Ajax enabled web-browser. The big advantage is that the same interface can be used on any graphical platform without the need to install additional libraries. The browser communicates with a local daemon which is doing the processing. The jQuery library implements Web2.0 and hides most JavaScript programming in a very clean way. jQuery is proud on its non-intrusiveness1. A number of experiments were made to create an understandable user interface, and discussed with a few people. Work on a new XML Schema and SOAP implementation for Perl is ongoing. The existing modules in Perl for SOAP are not validating, very incomplete, and unmaintainable in quality. Progress has been made on the final steps in the WSDL/SOAP code, completing this module.

{"title":"Project Mail::Box final report","description":"Project Mail::Box final report [ Mark Overmeer, MARKOV Solutions, 4 January 2004] Introduction Early 2002, foundation Stichting NLnet offered Mark Overmeer a grant to improve the development and user support for the Mail::Box software he had developed. The project started in May 2002, and was extended into a follow-up in January 2003. In December 2003, NLnet's involvement ends with this project final paper. Mail::Box is an Open Source software library for the Perl programming language. It is designed to help (mainly system administrators) implement automatic e-mail processing. For instance, it can be used to create automatic replies on incoming e-mail, do spam and virus filtering, and implement web-based e-mail clients. The software is released under GPL. This document describes the contributions to Mail::Box realized with the generous grant of Stichting NLnet. After completion of this sponsored project, the module will continue to be supported on voluntary basis. Software Development One of the areas covered by the project plan was pure software development, targeted to provide more \"weight\" to the library. Development took place on different aspects, of which the most important are listed below. Main concerns during the development were What do people want to do with automated e-mail scripts? How to provide the user with an interface which is so simple that mistakes against the rules (the RFCs) are hard to make. How do people want to do things? There are many different ways to construct a reply message, but in the library they should be handled in one place with a uniform and simple interface. Designing this interface is one of the most complex aspects of software development. All actions are without any user interaction: it must be able to run in stand-alone scripts. This requires a flexible approach on the input. For instance, the user expects to create an \"in-lined\" reply on an arriving text message, however a nested multi-part message with only binary information comes in... Still, the reply should be correct and look nice. The implementation must be platform independent and secure. Everything must be documented, and the source code understandable. These criteria are the main difference between the other e-mail related Perl modules and Mail::Box: other software only provides low level operations on simple messages, and expects users to create the smarter functionality. Releases The software is released under the GNU Public License (GPL), which means that everybody is free to use and redistribute it. Fixes and extensions made to the software must be made public, which in this case actually resulted in some contributions. As release model was chosen for a \"release often\" policy: new releases are made frequently. Each release contains bug-fixes and new features. Feedback about the release is swiftly handled to improve the next release. For a project with only one developer, it is not practicle to use a system with a development branch and a stable branch. When a new release doesn't break existing code, the need for a stable branch is even lower. Mail::Box therefore used a single track release schedule. When the NLnet project took off, Mail::Box 2.012 was current. At the end of the supported period, release 2.052 was reached. This gives an average of one release every two weeks, forty releases in total. Only a few of these releases were emergency fixes, which is a consequence of the release policy. New features The next sections will give some details about major developments during the time span of the project funded by NLnet. New folder types Folders (also named mailboxes ), are used to store groups of e-mail messages. When the project started, only the Mbox, MH were supported. These types are the most popular types on Unix systems. However, the target of Mail::Box is to create a folder type independent interface, which is usable on as many different platforms as possible. Maildir support was the first one to be added. It","url":"/project/mailbox/20040112-final-2.html"},
{"title":"Progress report May 2003","url":"/project/a-a-p/200305-progress.html","description":"Progress report May 2003 By Bram Moolenaar, June 2 2003 Examples Two larger examples have been made to show how Aap is useful for normal work: The ctags example The web site example As a side effect a few small items have been fixed in the Recipe Executive. Thus writing the recipes also functioned as a test. Variable naming To make the use of variables more consistent, some variables have been renamed. This causes incompatibilities with previous versions. That is why it had to be done now, before the 1.0 release. All variables that Aap uses internally all now all-caps. This makes them stand out in the recipe. The user can also still use this style, if he prepends \"MY\" before the name. If he doesn't do that, he takes the risc that in a future version of Aap the variable conflicts with the meaning Aap gives to it. To make the use of special characters simpler, they can now be given as $(x). This replaces the diverse methods that existed, such as $$ for \" $ \" and $bar for \" | \". The user no longer has to lookup in the manual what needs to be done to avoid the special meaning of a character. Wildcard expansion Previously the Python glob() function had to be used for wildcard expansion. Although this is nice to keep the meaning of variables consistent, most users prefer wildcards to be expanded directly. Wildcards are now expanded in every place where a file name is expected. To avoid expansion, the wildcard characters should be enclosed in square brackets. The wildescape() function has been added for this. This appears to be an acceptable complication, since file names with wildcard characters hardly ever appear. The result is that several recipe examples have become simpler. It is especially nice that the first few examples no longer have to use a Python expression in backticks. Tool support Different tools exist on various systems. Especially the C compiler works differently on various platforms. The tool mechanism was added to make it easy to add support for various tools and toolchains. This works with a plugin mechanism and Python files. The startup recipe contains code to figure out what tool to use by default. The user can overrule this and select his own tools with the \":usetool\" command. It is also possible to select a tool for a specific file, if needed. This is both easy to use and flexible. Some of the ideas have been taken over from SCons. This was combined with the Aap action mechanism, which makes it simpler to use. The actual tools to be used are still mostly to be filled in. Currently gcc and msvc are supported, so that it works on most Unix and MS-Windows systems. Various Support for rsync was added. This works like scp, but for files with small changes the transfer is much faster. rcp is also supported. Made it possible for the user to specify a different command to be used. Aap now also works on Mac OS&nbsp;X. Only a few small problems had to be solved. This is nice, because OS&nbsp;X comes with Python included, thus Aap works there right away. An \"add_VAR\" attribute can be used to append to a variable. A useful mechanism to define a macro or add an include path, instead of overruling the value with a \"var_VAR\" attribute. Details about the changes Progress The work mostly progressed as planned in May. A bit more time was spend on fixing bugs and improving existing items than expected. Adding the tool mechanism was not planned, but took only one day to add. This means we lag behind the original schedule a bit more than two weeks. This will probably be compensated by dropping the cross referencer work package. Two weeks were spend on making the examples. The Ctags example could be extended a bit further, especially the functionality for the maintainer is still limited. But that would take more time and doesn't provide the reader with extra insight in how Aap works. The presentation for the O'Reilly conference was created. This is only a first version, updates are possible until the presentation is given. It will"},

That is quite a lot, considering that other conferences are not doing well this year. Besides the huge number of presentations there were a lot of opportunities to meet with all kinds of open source software developers. The Aap presentation went well, although there were not as many attendees as I expected, about 25. There were eleven presentations in parallel and a build tool isn't \"sexy\" enough to attract a lot of attention. The BOF sessions, together with SCons, were visited by about ten people, including Guido van Rossum. Not many people, but they were very interested. Zimbu Award To stimulate developers to help making Aap and Agide grow and improve the Zimbu award will be handed out. Everybody helping the A-A-P project has a chance to get one of the three prizes. The award has been announced at the O'Reilly conference and various places on the internet. A few people have already made their first \"Zimbu points\" by submitting patches for Aap. More promotion is still desired, spread the word! More info at http://www.a-a-p.org/zimbu_award.html. Progress Because of the O'Reilly conference and a week of holidays only a couple of weeks remained for working on Aap. Most of this time was spent on communication, fixing bugs, improving the documentation and small additions. Thus lots of small things. Compared to the plan for version 1.0 the work lags behind about three weeks. Most of the planned work has been done, there are a few remaining work packages planned. But now that version 1.0 has been released it is about time to adjust the plan. Coming months Only two more months are remaining for the work funded by the Stichting NLnet Labs. Let's try to use this time as well as possible. The following is a short overview of what currently is planned to be done. Reactions from (potential) Aap users have guided the choice for what to do and what to drop. Followup on the 1.0 release: Cleaning up, bug fixing, improving the documentation, including patches, updating the web site, etc. This will take quite a bit of time, since the code is quite big now and every change must be tested for not breaking existing recipes. This will take about three weeks in total, spread out of the coming months. Add an autoconf-like configuration feature. SCons also has a similar feature, it would be a good idea to attempt working on this together. Joerg Beyer also has done some work on this, but has not shown progress the last two months. Closely related to this is automatically finding tools installed on the system (including compilers) and using them for building. I intend to work about two weeks on this. Simple installer. Quite a few people apparently find it too difficult to start using Aap and especially Agide. It can be made easier to install Aap by providing scripts that they can execute and/or clear point-by-point instructions. A week will be spend on this. Version control. The original plan was to add support for a system that does locking. However, I don't have experience with such a system. Instead I intend to add support for Subversion. This is expected to become very popular soon, since it is much better than CVS. We are just waiting for the 1.0 release. Since Subversion behaves very much like CVS this should take less than a week. Recipe finder / package installer. This is working for a limited number of packages. A need for users to upload recipes themselves has not been noticed. Therefore the work on this will be limited to adding a few packages and/or support for specific systems. This will not take more time than a couple of days. Dependency checker. Remarks have pointed out that the situation where an included header file is to be generated isn't handled properly. This is an essential feature, it will be implemented and tested. Also, adding another dependency checker should be made easier by moving"},

{"title":"Open Application for Project Financing","url":"/foundation/request/application.html","description":"Open Application for Project Financing The mission of the foundation \"Stichting NLnet\" is supporting network research and development in the domain of Internet technology based on open standards and the Open Source philosophy. application form One of the ways to accomplish this mission, is to financially support selected projects which potentially have positive impact on the wider dissemination and use of non-proprietary network and information exchange technologies. Organizations, groups, individuals, or companies can apply for financial support if their project meets the following criteria: the project shall stimulate the use of network and information exchange technologies for peaceful and humane purpose; the project results must be freely distributed, as part of a (proposed) open standard or in the case of software and/or hardware based on an adequate free software/open source license; the project team is ready to undertake efforts to disseminate project results; the requested project contributions does not exceed the amount of 30.000&euro; and the project would not last much longer than about one year. Even when your project meets the above criteria, the NLnet project selection committee reserves the right to reject the project proposal with or without reasoning, or to delay the contribution to a later moment. Note that projects do not need to be technological in nature; also projects targeting to promote the wider use of non-proprietary network and information exchange technologies may get accepted. The requestor may propose combined financing with a third party, when the project budget goes substantially above 30.000&euro;, provided that such cooperation does not question the independent position of NLnet. The above requirement --that project results shall be freely distributed based on Open Source principles-- does not necessarily mean that these results can not be commercially utilized. On the contrary: building up of profitable business on the project results is applauded. It is appreciated if a separate plan is drawn for dissemination of project results. Where necessary, a dedicated dissemination budget can be outlined in the project plan. The acceptance process normally followed by NLnet is described here: &nbsp; Activity Start End 1 Proposal submission Any time See the website for calls 2 Primary selection 1st week 2nd week 3 Secondary selection 4 Discussing and agreeing of project plans 5 Signing memorandum of understanding (contract) 6 Advance payment (if any) 7 Approving progress report / quarterly payment quarterly - 8 Final payment after close-up - This is described in more detail: Open applications for project financing can be submitted any time to the NLnet project selection committee via our web-based application form. However, the selection process starts only at the date announced on the website. Your proposal will not be rejected when it is received after these dates, rather the assessment of your proposal will be shifted to a next following selection round. In the first two weeks from the start of a selection round, the selection committee makes a first filtering based on the above outlined criteria. The project teams will be notified about the outcome of this initial selection in the third week of the round. The second selection round is used to pick projects which not only satisfy the criteria, but also have potentially the most impact on society. Project teams will be notified on the results of the second round as soon as possible. On this moment, the final answer is given whether NLnet intends to financially support (part of) the project. Subsequently there is a period for submitting additional detail and further negotiation on the project plans(*) and budgeting, as well as examining the memorandum of understanding between NLnet and the project submitter (see the sample MoU in PDF). This period might take longer if a third party participates in project financing. After that, the project memorandum"},

(They will each receive $5k at the start of a milestone, $1k on the completion of each subsystem for the milestone, and $3.5k on completion of the milestone.) Wytze van der Raay, financial director for NLnet, commented \"NLnet has observed the evolution of Perl into one of the essential tools for developing internet applications and managing internet services. The Parrot architecture is promising to add features of special importance to network applications, while simultaneously opening up the technology for several other dynamic languages. One of NLnet's major goals is to remove road-blocks for Open Source projects like Parrot.

{"title":"NLnet Labs; Description","url":"/project/nlnetlabs/description.html","description":"NLnet Labs; description [Foundation Stichting NLnet Labs -- long term commitment] The remarkably fast growth of the Internet and its technology is, in the NLnet Foundation's opinion, primarily due to the permanent free availability of protocol specifications and the reference implementations of these specifications. The free exchange of modules and applications has often led to the development of completely new applications and network services, like browsers (Mosaic) and encryption technology (SSH, PGP). This \"open\"-ness has had a very stimulating influence, and maintaining and protecting this situation is deemed crucial for the survival of a healthy Internet world. One of the ways to realize the above is to contribute materially to the expansion and maintenance of the large pool of open source software for the Internet. The term open source is being used here as a catch-all for a large variety of models for the unrestricted development and distribution of software in source form (GNU Public License, BSD license, Artistic license etc.). Open source software is used on a large scale in the Netherlands; however, contributions to its development are found to a lesser degree. By bundling a number of talented developers in the form of a software development laboratory, a new impulse can be given to the latter. To implement the above philosophy, the NLnet Foundation has established a new entity with the name Stichting NLnet Labs (NLnet Labs Foundation). NLnet Labs is a stichting (Foundation) under Dutch law, and will employ a group of 4 to 6 talented software developers to work on developing and maintaining open source style software for the Internet. NLnet Labs activities started on January 1, 2000. A detailed overview of its current and past activities can be found on the NLnet Labs website ."},

Gauw brengt zo'n 17 jaar ervaring in de internetwereld met zich mee, waaronder de laatste zes jaar als commercieel directeur van een van 's werelds grootste internetexchanges, NL-ix. Daarvoor was hij al eerder vier jaar lang voorzitter van het bestuur van de Amsterdam Internet Exchange. Gauw kijkt uit naar zijn nieuwe functie. \"Er zijn zeker in het afgelopen jaar een aantal zaken aan het licht gekomen die een veranderd perspectief geven op de feitelijke gezondheid van het huidige internet\", zo stelt hij. \"Veiligheid en privacy van gebruikers blijken veel minder goed geborgd dan vaak gedacht werd. NLnet werkt al meer dan twintig jaar - buiten het zicht van het grote publiek - aan het open en veilig houden van het internet zoals we het allemaal ooit voor ogen hadden. Dat is nu harder nodig dan ooit, en het is tijd om daar ook mee op de voorgrond te treden en ook nieuwe middelen voor vrij te maken.\" De geschiedenis van NLnet gaat terug tot 1982 toen onder leiding van internetpionier en latere NLnet-directeur Teus Hagen het eerste pan-Europese UNIX-computernetwerk werd opgericht.

{"title":"MAPS; Description","description":"MAPS; description [Mail Abuse Protection System -- 1999/01/01] Unsolicited distribution of (nearly always commercial) e-mail (SPAM) is causing problems, due to unnecessary use of time and resources at the receiver side, and often&nbsp; misuse of resources of third parties (MTA relays) by the sender. A number of people haven taken (mainly technical) actions to prevent SPAM, often in an uncoordinated fashion at the receiver side. Paul Vixie (known from a.o. ISC ), on his own personal initiative and responsibility, has compiled a black list of senders, by tracing the senders of SPAM using his deep technical Internet knowledge. When contacting the sender and/or his ISP by telephone or e-mail, and advising with respect to counter-measures against SPAM does not have the desired results, the Internet addresses in question are added to a black list named R ealtime B lackhole L ist (RBL). Then the M ail A buse P rotection S ystem ( MAPS ) allows Internet users to use this RBL in various ways for blocking e-mail, or even possibly all network traffic originating from the non-cooperating SPAM'mer. To ensure the continuity of the MAPS system, and to remove the personal legal risks for Paul Vixie, the non-profit organisation MAPS, LLC has been established in California, USA. NLnet Foundation attempted to support this initiative financially in 1998, but this did not succeed due to a number of fundamental contractual problems.

{"title":"Mail::Box phase 2, last progress report","description":"Mail::Box phase 2, last progress report December 5, 2003, Mark Overmeer. Report on the progress of the Mail::Box phase 2 project in the last weeks of the project. A final report, with an overview of what was achieved during Mail::Box phase 1 and 2, is expected soon. 1. Tasks The following tasks where described in the project plan of phase 2. For each task, the final status is described. User support This consumes a lot of time, and will continue to do so. The current state of documentation is much better than before, which has reduced the number of simple questions. The current support needs are much more complicated, and need more time to solve. Replacing old modules Converting old code to MailBox is quite simple now, but that doesn't mean that many people are doing this. It mainly helps people with experience with the old code to understand Mail::Box better. Documentation No major documentation rewrite in this period. The documentation is in good shape, with all of the (about 1000) methods are described. IMAP4 support IMAP4 is now partially functional: opening a connection to the server, reading and writing messages, and modifying labels is now possible. This was a major effort, because IMAP is smart and MailBox too, which means that they both want to control over the activities. Many configuration parameters are introduced to speed-up IMAP access. Outlook support No changes in this final period, it simply works. Database folders The idea on what this documentation should become has shaped, but the text has not been written yet. This is still an open item. Digital Signing No progress has been made on signing messages. I have reports of people using external modules to check signatures, but a nice integration needs more studying first: especially about different practices. Unicode support Some people are using it, and a some progress has been made. Unicode itself is working, but this comes with the need to have high-level understanding of all the different kinds of header fields. That is complex task, which is progressing, but not at high speed. Mailing list construction Again, two more kinds of mailing list software can be detected. This is specially useful to remove the related fields from messages which are displayed or stored (these fields are often numerous and of little use: only the name of the list is of interest). Browser support HTML::FromMail implements a template system which connects to Mail::Box. You can develop powerful web-mail clients, with only little knowledge about Mail::Box. This modules needs promotion, probably at the some German Perl Workshop, in February 2004. 2. Releases In these final two months, only three releases for Mail::Box version 2.053: Thu Dec 4 00:13:50 CET 2003 version 2.052: Wed Dec 3 21:04:45 CET 2003 version 2.051: Mon Nov 3 16:16:09 CET 2003 Release 2.052 is a major one, introducing IMAP and many speed improvements. There have been some minor developments in spin-off modules, but they have not been released yet. Tim Sellar, Matthew Darwin, Nick Ing-Simmons, Anthony D.&nsbp;Urso, 'asta', and Lutz Gehlen contributed code and ideas. 3. Promotion There was no time left to develop more promotional activities. 4. Mailing list The mailing list sees weird fluctuations in activity: when someone starts asking things, many follow the same day... and then it dies out again. The activity of the last months: &nbsp; December 32 (first 4 days!) &nbsp; November 47 &nbsp; &nbsp; October 26 &nbsp; ( September 34 ) A larger part of the communication is NOT going via the list, simply to avoid boring people too much. Since the previous evaluation, September 30st, about 270 messages where exchanged. The number of subscribers on the mailing list has steadily grown to 118, with about one new subscriber a week. However, many support requests are (initially) not made through the mailing list. 5. Plans for the near future Before the end of this year, the IMAP code will be tested for the remaining untested","url":"/project/mailbox/20031205-report.html"},

{"title":"Mail::Box 2, Second Progress Report","url":"/project/mailbox/20030715-report.html","description":"Mail::Box 2, Second Progress Report 15 July 2003, Mark Overmeer, MARKOV Solutions. In the last two months A period of two months is rather short when a large conference and some days off are included. In my case, these where joined into one extended stay in Florida to visit YAPC::NA. Participation of YAPC::NA At arrival, there was only one slot of 90 minutes allocate for my talks, which I used to present the Mail::Box distribution to the American audience. During the three days of the conference, some other small spots fell open of which I claimed three more talks: 20 minutes for OODoc (Object Oriented Documentation) and twice 5 minutes for Hash::Case and Object::Realize::Later, other modules that I wrote. Mail::Box (90 minutes tutorial) The presented Mail::Box talk was based on the talks given at the previous YAPC::EU and German Perl Workshop, but adapted to include more of the new features and some problem areas. As far as I can tell, all of the about 30 spectators saw this presentation for the first time. The presentation will continue to develop, showing more examples and demonstrating some powerful features, which will result in a close to new presentation for YAPC::EU (compared to that of YAPC::EU last year). Those slides will be published on the Net. Mail::Box documentation After the transition of the documentation system to use OODoc was completed in the previous period, the benefits of the new set-up became visible. Without the fear to lose overview on the documentation, the manual can grow much larger now. As main feature, larger parts of the documentation were reorganized, which can been seen at This page will grow into a large doc/faq/example collection. Small developments The new Outlook DBX and message rebuild functionalities didn't cause any problems for users, but they have already found a few users. Some improvements where made to help people with large mailboxes: it is now very simple to remove unimportant header fields, sets of \"resent group\" headers, and mailing list related headers from memory and folders. A major memory leak was fixed with a contributed module [written by Todd Richmond] which replaced the use of the leaking external module. This may save up to 40% of memory! Mail::Box is still demanding considerable amounts of memory, which is mainly caused by the way Perl is organized internally. An other way to save memory is the new message \"destruct\" function, which frees-up the message from memory and at the same time catches the situations where the message data is accidentally being used after destruction. This is a clean hack, and only useful for people with large folders. Major developments Progress has been made in the list of tasks in the Mail::Box phase 2 project plan, however not all are already visible to the users. The main reason behind this is that visiting and preparing three conferences within 5 month consumes that much time that development can be started but not be finished: fixing the last bugs, creating enough tests, and writing the general documentation of each new feature takes some extra effort and concentration that in cannot be combined. Two major parts of the plan are therefore still in my development tree as alpha code: unicode headers which parse all the features of e-mail addresses and mailing list header support are close to ready. The IMAP implementation has started, as well as the destription how to use Mail::Box with databases. Unicode headers for addresses In parallel to Mail::Box, I maintain a distribution named User::Identity, which stores user related data. On this moment, that software is stepwise integrated with Mail::Box as alternative for some older external modules. An example shows what you can do with it (even without detailed knowledge of Perl, this should be understandable): use User::Identity; my $patrik = User::Identity->new ( name => 'patrik', full_name => \"Patrik_F\\xE4ltstr\\xF6m\", charset => \"ISO-8859-1\" ); $patrik->add(email => \"him@home.net\"); my $b"},
{"title":"LogReport; Description","description":"LogReport; description [LogReport -- concluded on 2004/09] In April 2000, NLnet Foundation's board was approached by a group of people in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, with a plan to establish a website aimed at log file processing. The website would be supported by a new organisation aimed at solving log file problems in a wider sense (knowledge dissemination, tool development, report generation service etc.). After several long discussions, this culminated in August 2000 with the establishment of LogReport Foundation, a non-profit framework for performing the activities outlined above. The goals of the LogReport Foundation are the following: development, maintenance and distribution of tools and knowledge for processing log files of network/computer system applications and generating reports based on such log files; stimulating the use of the above tools and knowledge in the management of information systems; convincing authors of network/computer system applications to integrate support in their applications for generating useful standardized and machine-processable log file information; contributing to the development and adoption of product independent log file formats (standards); creating a forum for system managers and software developers in the area of log file information applications and analysis. The Open Source philosophy is a leading idea for all activities of the LogReport Foundation: all software and documentation developed by or under contract from the LogReport Foundation will be made freely available in source form to the network community.

{"title":"LOAP; Description","url":"/project/loap/description.html","description":"LOAP; description [The DNS: Life of a Protocol -- concluded on 2006/06] \"The DNS: A Life of a Protocol\" [working title of the project] is a technopolitical analysis of the life of the Domain Name System, using it as a lens to look at the broader issue of \"Internet Governance,\" a term that was poorly choosen but is much in use. Starting as a simple replacement for an even simpler host file, the DNS protocol has grown into a big business, a quasi governmental international framework, and a strategic battleground for trademarks wars. Research on this project began in late 2004. It has gone through several incarnations, starting as a book. In the fall of 2005, some real progress was made when the author convinced the ITU that he was \"bona fide media,\" which resulted in his attendance at the WSIS Tunis meeting, where the festivities were duly filmed. Following that, Carl conducted filmed interviews with a variety of root server operators, regional registries, former IETF officials, current ICANN officials, and various inventors and maintainers of the DNS. This results of this investigation work will be packaged as a \"movie\" intended for general audiences in mid-2006. Since this is about the Internet, it seems to make sense to take the raw interviews with people such as DNS inventor Paul Mockapetris and release them on the net in their raw state. This means, when watching the final edited movie, the viewer can go back to the full interviews (or even mix their own movie). Currently, most of the field interviews have been conducted and over 75 high-def and DVCAM tapes have been digitized. Raw footage should start showing up on the net by the end of January and we expect the final product/movie to be available for down-load by mid-year."},
{"title":"Jabber/XMMP; Description","url":"/project/xmpp/description.html","description":"Jabber/XMMP; description [strengthening Trust in Jabber/XMPP Technologies -- concluded on 2008/01] Jabber technologies, as formalized in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ), are a set of decentralized, open technologies for near-real-time messaging, presence, and streaming XML (now being extended to address multimedia signalling and other advanced use cases). In order to understand how to improve the security and trust characteristics of Jabber technologies, one needs to understand some of their key characteristics: Jabber/XMPP is not a typical open-source project; because the Jabber community is centered on a wire protocol rather than a particular codebase, it consists of many open-source projects, freeware and shareware developers, and commercial software companies. The role of the XMPP Standards Foundation ( XSF ) is to define protocols through open debate and discussion, then encourage the implementation of those protocols by the many decentralized projects and companies in the Jabber community. Jabber/XMPP technologies are also deployed in a highly decentralized fashion, typically in a client-server architecture that is quite similar to email (but also sometimes in a local mesh or peer-to-peer architecture through the use of zero-configuration networking). As a result, there is a large network of Jabber servers on the Internet, plus many servers operating behind firewalls on organizational intranets. However, few Jabber/XMPP servers are deployed in a high-security fashion (e.g., with non-self-signed certificiates). The core Jabber/XMPP protocols underwent rigorous cross-area and security review within the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) in 2002-2004, resulting in a strong security profile through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for channel encryption and Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) for authentication. However, work remains to be done in extending XMPP to include end-to-end encryption, strong identity, server and endpoint reputation, and per-hop reliability. This project concentrates on ways to strengthen the security and trust characteristics of Jabber technologies, the open network of Jabber servers, and communication among Jabber clients. While future proposals may define ways to extend those achievements, baseline security is a higher priority and therefore is the focus of this proposal. In particular, two main sub-projects will take place: Strengthening server trust by stimulating implementation and deployment of existing Jabber/XMPP protocols for encryption and strong authentication of client-to-server and server-to-server connections. Strengthening endpoint trust by completing development, iteratively improving, and encouraging deployment of strong, easy-to-use end-to-end encryption technologies over the Jabber network.

{"title":"IIDS; Description","description":"IIDS; description [Interactive Intelligent Distributed Systems -- concluded on 2013/04] The IIDS group's research focuses on management of large-scale interactive distributed systems. Management of large-scale distributed \"open\" systems is a challenge, especially if autonomous processes are part of the model. In closed systems, with their own sets of rules and obligations, some form of central control may be possible. In open systems this is not the case. Trust and security clearly play an important role inhibiting centralized management. Local management becomes increasingly more important. Self-management is the next step: self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection of autonomous systems. Together they make it possible for large-scale systems to fend for themselves. As good understanding of configuration and reconfiguration processes is mandatory for the first two aspects. Agents are examples of processes that may roam the Internet. They are autonomous, can communicate with each other and interact with services and objects. As a result they may, for example, negotiate contracts, perform transactions, but also decide to spawn off new agents to perform specific tasks. This clearly does not decrease the complexity of managing large-scale distributed open systems on the Internet: it emphasises the need for new technology. New types of directory services, for example, are needed. Which technology should be used to design these services, is, however, unclear. The research programme of IIDS focuses on the implications of the use of mobile processes, of agents in particular: the technology needed to develop and manage large scale agent systems. Scalability, reliability, security, and heterogeneity of such systems are aspects that need to be considered if the Internet is ever to be used to its full potential. Middleware, services and applications are the main parts of this programme. Middleware, together with services, provides the support. Self-management of the middleware is a next step in this line of research. Applications provide insight in requirements and provide the means with which to evaluate the results. The focus of the research continues to be (1) on the middleware AgentScape Operating System (AOS) and the related services, in particular configuration services, and (2) on the legal implications of the use of agent systems. The Java version of the AgentScape middleware will provide a more stable basis for application development and support.","url":"/project/iids/description.html"},

{"title":"Globule; Description","description":"Globule; description [Globule for Windows -- concluded on 2005/09/01] Globule is a research project that aims at developing a user-centric Content Delivery Network (CDN). Such a network consists as an overlay in which the nodes are owned by end users rather than ISPs. In Globule, nodes transparently collaborate to provide strong guarantees with respect to performance and availability of Web documents. To this end, we have developed modules that extend the basic functionality of the Apache2 Web server, and take care of automatically replicating Web documents, and redirecting clients to the replica server that can best service the request. Globule has been developed for UNIX platforms, and has been tested on Solaris and Linux. The current target of the project is to make Globule easily available for a large group of potential users, in particular those that have Windows machines. Users of Globule on Windows will initially be able to set up a Web site on their own machine of which the content is managed by standard tools such as Word and Netscape Composer. The main reason for wanting to make Globule available for Windows is that Globule is designed to run on end-user machines. We aim at wide-spread deployment, which then makes the Windows community a better target than the focusing only on the UNIX community. There are many benefits in establishing a reasonable-sized user base, including feedback on bugs, performance, usability, functionality, usefulness, and so on. In general, it will lead to an improvement of Globule as a whole. Another important reason is that by explicitly focusing on general end users (rather than technical, UNIX-oriented users), we believe that requirements for functional enhancements will be properly prioritized. By concentrating on important user requirements, we should be able to more easily establish a user base, which, in turn contributes to the potential success of the project. Although the project has its internal goal set to promote the use of Globule and its support for adaptive replication, what would make Globule attractive for (Windows) end users is that they can set up a Web site on their own personal computer, which remains available even when that computer is shut down. Availability while being disconnected, combined with pure local development and maintenance will be the selling point for WinGlob.","url":"/project/globule/description.html"},
{"title":"FSF Europe; Description","description":"FSF Europe; description [Free Software Foundation Europe -- concluded on 2010/11] The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSF Europe) was founded in 2001 as the sister organization of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) in the USA to take care of all aspects of Free Software in Europe. Several factors made this step necessary. First of all, Free Software has ceased being an American phenomenon, Europe has one of the strongest communities of Free Software developers and many considerable projects of the recent past have their roots in Europe. Secondly, the dominating perception of software is as a purely economic property, which is why it is being treated this way by politics and press. But software already transcends daily life in an increasing manner and becomes a deciding factor. Just as other developments in the past of mankind, software develops from being an economic to a cultural property with increasing presence in everyday life. Other than developments that seem to be comparable at first glance like printing press, car or telephone, software is purely virtual. It can not only be reproduced without loss, this reproduction also serves its evolution. This makes software have properties that are very different from those of other phenomenons in history; the invention of software probably has the biggest similarities with the discovery of language, writing or science. It is essential for the future of mankind that software as a cultural property will remain accessible for everyone and is preserved in libraries like other knowledge. In order to achieve this, a new way of thinking has to be established with the decision-makers of the population, the politicians. To inspire this new way of thinking is a crucial task for the FSF Europe. The third objective is securing Free Software. The GNU General Public License and GNU Lesser General Public License of the Free Software Foundation are the most-often licenses used Therefore it is incumbent on the FSF and FSF Europe to ensure the legal safety of the largest part of Free Software. Fourthly, the long-term success is based upon the practical realization of Free Software. Because of this, the FSF Europe and the FSF work together on the organizatory aspects of the GNU Project, assist and maintain the development of Free Software and support companies and people willing to switch to Free Software. And finally, software contains an immense commercial potential. In order to permanently build the awareness for Free Software, it is necessary to also involve the economy. This means perspectives need to be opened for companies to build their business on or around Free Software. Offering these perspectives and counseling in their application is also a task for the FSF Europe. Further considerations on the topic of Free Software can be found at: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html .","url":"/project/fsfeurope/description.html"},

The organisation, working closely with Harald Welte of gpl-violations.org, seeks to help programmers properly set up and organise projects legally, as well as educate companies to understand how the GPL works. As needed, the purpose of the group will also include enforcement in the case of licence violations. FTF is located in FSFE's offices in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland. \"Free Software itself has become commercial mainstream, but knowledge about Free Software and in particular its licences is often lagging behind,\" explains Georg Greve, FSFE's president. \"With large companies like SUN embracing Free Software at the heart of their business, the software ecosystem is transforming in ways that underline the requirement for services like the FTF.\" FTF will include experts with technical and legal backgrounds as well as volunteers, working together to provide organised and co-ordinated responses to individual cases where there may be misunderstandings about what a licence requires or a violation of its terms. FSFE has hired Mr. Shane Coughlan to serve as FTF Co-ordinator. Shane Coughlan on the other tasks of the FTF: \"We seek to give commercial and non-commercial Free Software developers the maximum support possible with our fiduciary activities. By helping them bundle their legal interests, we are able to safeguard the legal status of a project while it can focus on technological and managerial issues. For projects that FSFE has accepted into its fiduciary program, FSFE will also be in a position to defend their interests in the eventuality of licence violation.\" Harald Welte, the first person who enforced the GNU GPL in court, will be working closely with the FTF: \"My gpl-violations.org work has shown how much the community needs a more focussed approach to deal with these violations. While there was good contact with FSFE in the past, we will now be working closely together, sharing our information and resources to best protect the rights of Free Software developers.\" \"We have as a primary goal to help corporations to adhere to the licences from the onset, rather than to have to enforce violations later,\" explains Mr. Coughlan. \"We encourage those responsible for compliance for their company to contact us, so we can work together to avoid licence compliance problems, rather than having to later solve problems that could have been avoided in the first place.\" Stichting NLnet Chairman Teus Hagen expressed pleasure at the launch of FTF: \"We are very happy to support the launch of the FTF because in our view this is a timely and necessary step to consolidate Free Software. We ourselves at times felt the need for a reliable partner to handle these issues, and in our experience the FSFE is such a partner. We hope that many others will contribute to and support this effort, and see the FTF as an important step in the maturing of Free Software.\"","url":"/project/fsfeurope/20061113-freedom.html"},
{"title":"Final Report about the AGFL/GNU Project","description":"Final Report about the AGFL/GNU Project The goal of the AGFL/GNU project is to make the AGFL linguistic parser generator system publicly available as a tool for the development of applications involving the linguistic processing of full-text documents. The project, sponsored for 20 man-months by Stichting NLnet from January 2000 to September 2001, consisted of the following tasks: to revise the AGFL formalism to bring the notation in line with other forms of Affix Grammars (EAG, CDL3) the introduction of lexical and syntactical probabilities improvement of the performance of AGFL parsers production of documentation and examples to bring the AGFL system under the GNU Public License a Web-based application to show AGFL's usefulness. ACHIEVEMENTS 1. The Revision In cooperation with the maintainers of CDL3 (Paul Jones) and EAG (Marc Seutter) the syntax and semantics of CDL3 has been revised. The revised language definition forms part of the user manual. The three different Affix Grammar formalisms can now be understood as different sets of restrictions on a general formalism. The inconveniences caused to current AGFL users by the modifications in notation are mitigated somewhat by the provision of a migration tool for converting lexica. Kees Koster is working on a text book uniting the AG formalisms. 2. Probabilistic parsing The revised syntax includes both syntactical and lexical probabilities. The lexical probabilities have been implemented in the lexicon generation system and the analysis phase, allowing the use of probabilistic parsing to obtain the most probable analysis of a sentence. In combination with the newly introduced segment parsing, this makes AGFL parsers useful for practical applications in Information Retrieval. Lexical probabilities can be obtained from readily available tagged corpora. Syntactic probabilities are for the time being ignored, but they can be implemented later when the required syntactic data become available. 3. Performance improvement The performance of the parser generator itself, and in particular the generation of lexica, has been improved so much that a complete compilation of a grammar and an associated lexicon of 300 000 entires is performed in less than a minute, making the AGFL system suitable for tight development cycles. In optimizing the performance of the parsers generated by the system, we have been less successful. An elaborate positive and negative memoization technique has been implemented, but this development has not yet led to a significant speedup. 4. Documentation A new user manual has been written, comprizing an informal introduction to AGFL, the language definition and a chapter about transduction and input modes. Many small examples should help linguists in understanding transduction, probabilistic parsing and robustness strategies. For computer scientists, the main attraction will be the free English grammar and lexicon EP4IR, which allow anybody to generate parsers for inclusion in his own applications. Implementation documentation is included in the source texts, but it is sparing and cryptic in a typical academic way. 5. Bringing AGFL under GNU The KUN and the developers of AGFL have agreed to transfer their rights on the AGFL system to the Free Software Foundation. At present the system is still under evaluation by their reviewers. In the mean time the system is freely available under GPL conditions, apart from the runtime system which is under LGPL conditions. 6. Web-based application It was agreed with Stichting NLnet that an attractive web-relevant application of AGFL should be provided (for those who find an English parser too abstract). To this end, a system for searching, navigating and browsing a collection of documents based on a user-specified profile of phrases (rather than keywords) was implemented. Given the short time available, the system is no more than a demonstrable prototype, but (after improving the efficiency of the AGFL system) it can serve as a","url":"/project/agfl/200201-finalreport.html"},

As such, these certificates establish a Web of Trust in the Open Source certificate services area. Several years ago, Thawte initiated a similar approach, but their service is only free for the email certificates used by many browsers. The CAcert initiative goes further, providing non-commercial server certificates signing services by building a Web of Trust community.

{"title":"Decibel gets up steam","description":"Decibel gets up steam [On 31 May 2006, Stefan Eilers reports:] Decibel has seen some changes to the original plans. As one of our aims is to integrate the framework seamlessly into the desktop, Decibel has now become an official KDE project. This helps us contact its community for assistance and feedback. This will hopefully decrease their prejudices against companies and Open Source projects. As a first result, a developer came forward interested to do the desktop integration with us. Furthermore, We compared the Telepathy project with the Tapioca project. On first impression, both seemed fairly the same, and we ignored Tapioca a little bit. However, looking more deeply we learned that Tapioca fits to our vision much better. Both Tapioka and Telepathy is developed by Gnome devoted developers. But the Tapioca developers are working at the Nokia institute for technology and they are thinking less religious and more like engineers. Switching over, we will not loose the Gnome community but will gain the better communicative counterpart. But there are technical advantages, too. While Telepathy lacked a clear interface to user space, Tapioca does already have a desktop API, allowing us to focus on the framework alone. To summarize our progress: The community process is starting off. Using KDE as example implementation, we are now more visible in the community. The basis framework needs some improvements but is already in good shape. The members of the Tapioca project are really motivated to work with us. While the framework itself will stay independent to any desktop environment, we will be able to use KDE as demonstration platform.","url":"/project/decibel/20060531-steam.html"},
{"title":"Decibel; Description","description":"Decibel; description [Open communication desktop interface -- concluded on 2007/09/01] The aim of this initial project --which started off under the name OpenCDI-- is to create a platform independent telephony framework for the implementation of Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) and telephony applications. It provides a simple method to access conventional PSTN hardware as well as IP telephony setups. The applications use Decibel as a desktop service interface. Thus it represents the interface to local communication middleware. The main infrastructure of Decibel will be implemented with libraries that are part of the upcoming LSB&nbsp;3 standard and that are available on other platforms like Windows and Linux Embedded as well. This includes libraries such as {\\tt libstdc++}, glib, and Qt. Decibel sits on top of the Tapioca framework, which will provide the basic communication interfaces and protocol implementations. Tapioca is the implementation of the Telepathy architecture, which defines the DBUS protocol specification for integrating various components. This assures interoperability between platforms. We intend to create a framework that sits on top of the Tapioca API; to share communities and to work together. The use of the existing IPC specification enables the use of existing Tapioca backends. Where necessary, we will extend the existing framework and specifications and discuss this with the community. The communication protocol used by the applications will be DBUS, using the protocol specification provided by the Tapioca project. The architecture of the framework will consist of a plugin structure which can be extended easily. These plugins (called backends) provide resource services which are handled by the service manager. One of them will provide an adapter which accesses PBX systems (CTI 3rd party control). Others contain a softphone implementation (CTI 1st party control) or a remote control of a hardphone (CTI 1st party control). Additional backends will provide services for audio subsystems, audio codecs, video codecs, media protocols, etc. The backend interfaces will be discussed with the Tapioca project, so that we can make sure Tapioca backends work with Decibel and vice versa. Decibel will be independent to any desktop environment, but the first proof of concept implementation will be integrated into the KDE- Desktop environment to show its power and flexibility.","url":"/project/decibel/description.html"},

The targets were successfully met. In short: Decibel released version 0.5.0 and the Telepathy connection manager for snom VoIP phone released version 0.4.0. The development sprint has been intense, but the team reached the goals as planned. Decibel now has the following status: The Tapioca Telepathy bindings (both Telepathy Qt and Tapioca Qt) were updated to include all the required updates. This code was added to the Tapioca SVN archive, and will be part of the next release. Telepathy-snom (the test connection manager) was updated to the new Telepathy specification and DTMF support was added. Decibel was updated to work with the new Telepathy specification. A channel history service got added to the core functionality. This service keeps a log of all communication channels as seen by Decibel including their direction, communication partners, and timestamps for connection, channel creation and closing. KCall does use this channel history to display a call history. KCall was ported to Decibel (and KDE4). It is feature complete, but still needs testing. It is expected to be released soon. A whitepaper on the purpose and benefits of Decibel was written and will be published after the internal review process."},

A non-Perl centric paper on CPAN6 was prepared and presented on two conferences. The promotional effort took much more time than estimated in the project plan. Promotion Mark Overmeer contributions to the YAPC::Europe conference (European Perl Conference, 28-30 August in Vienna Austria, 350 conference participants): 60 minutes on CPAN6, introduction and demo; 45 minutes on XML::Compile::SOAP, a CPAN6 derivative; 45 minutes on Log::Report, another CPAN6 derivative; 1 minute lighting-talk to call for language translations of core Perl (not CPAN6 related) 30 minutes BoF on CPAN6 At the European Linux Conference (2-5 september in Cambridge England, about 250 participants), he contributed: 45 minutes on CPAN6, introduction The paper and presentation materials are made available via http://cpan6.org and http://perl.overmeer.net. Most feedback came on the XML work. The CPAN6 ideas are still too abstract to be understood by the average programmer. At the Linux conference, the response was clearly on a higher level than in the Perl community, but this did not lead to any volunteers for the CPAN6 core yet. Four Perl professionals volunteered for the XML SOAP testing, on the other hand. Implementation On the implementation side, the effort still focusses on creating the best possible framework to base the CPAN6 implementation on. The XML::Compile message parser was reimplemented fully, just to support the last few (quite rare) remote corners of the Schema specification. Feedback from the community shows that the current behavior is very satisfying. Work on a new general purpose module has started: Log::Report::View helps document system messages. In various interfaces, you need views on the same text. For instance, a graphical item needs translations, a tool-tip, and a description to be included in a web-page, each translated into various languages. This new Perl module is an attempt to localize these related fragments to avoid mistakes. Upcoming For the coming months, less time can be spend on promotion in favor of software development. The target the initial software release still is FOSDEM 2008. The website will be redesigned soon, and a meeting with KDE core developers is planned."},

{"title":"CPAN6; Description","description":"CPAN6; description [CPAN6 -- concluded on 2011/02] People are designed to collect things, whether it is food, postal stamps, or digital information. On our hard-drives, we collect software, photos, development sources, documents, music, e-mail, and much more. The typical application sees this `collecting' as secundary problem to their main task, offering little help in administering the data produced with it. CPAN6 focusses purely on this aspect, and can therefore improve the way people work in general. Brief history The Perl community has a very succesfull module archive, named CPAN. In just over 11 years, it has collected more than 11,000 different open source modules, contributed by thousands of authors. Many other programming language communities have tried to create their own version of CPAN, but none was so successful yet. One of the disadvantages of CPAN is that it is very much entangled with Perl5, so it cannot be used to implement other archives. And this starts to bite the Perl community itself as well: with the upcoming release of Perl6 (with Parrot as large product aside), the old infrastructure needs a major overhaul. In the process of abstracting the archive's functionality --combining the features of CPAN with modern needs like authentication-- it was discovered that the resulting design could benefit close to all applications: every time someone collects any form of digital information. Even, to organize ones home directory. Now, the target for CPAN6 has become to be included as Open/Save option in any application.","url":"/project/cpan6/description.html"},

De stichting Bits of Freedom (BOF) heeft zich sinds 2000 ingezet voor digitale burgerrechten zoals privacy op internet en vrijheid van meningsuiting. Het bestuur ziet geen mogelijkheid om Bits of Freedom voort te zetten nu de twee vaste medewerkers van BOF (Maurice Wessling en Sjoera Nas) allebei vertrekken. Het kantoor van Bits of Freedom wordt daarom per 1&nbsp;september 2006 gesloten. Na die datum zijn er geen medewerkers meer in dienst. De stichting blijft wel bestaan, zodat het bestuur de jaarlijkse uitreiking van de Big Brother Awards kan voortzetten met behulp van vrijwilligers. In de afgelopen maanden heeft het bestuur allerlei scenario's bedacht om Bits of Freedom met andere medewerkers voort te zetten. Maar geen van deze mogelijkheden bleek uiteindelijk realistisch. Karin Spaink, de voorzitter van het bestuur, kan door ziekte een eventuele doorstart niet begeleiden. Een andere, bijkomende, oorzaak voor de opheffing is de voortdurende onzekerheid over de financi&euml;n van BOF. De stichting heeft geen reserves en ondanks genereuze sponsoring van bedrijven en gulle donaties van particulieren was het elk jaar erg moeilijk om een sluitende begroting te maken. De beslissing valt het bestuur en medewerkers zwaar en is pas genomen na lang nadenken en zorgvuldig overwegen van alternatieven. Bits of Freedom heeft zich sinds de oprichting ingezet voor de handhaving van grondrechten in het digitale tijdperk. In die zes jaar hebben zowel overheden als bedrijven heel veel maatregelen genomen waarbij burgerrechten in de knel zijn gekomen. De overheid heeft haar bevoegdheden op veel terreinen uitgebreid. In plaats van gerichte speurtochten naar de activiteiten van mensen die verdacht worden van ernstige misdrijven, werpen de opsporingsautoriteiten steeds gemakkelijker grote sleepnetten uit naar het alledaagse gedrag van onverdachte burgers. De persoonlijke levenssfeer wordt daardoor onnodig ver ingeperkt. Daarbij zijn de noodzakelijkheid en effectiviteit van veel beoogde maatregelen ten onrechte vaak onderbelicht. Waar in de jaren negentig de transparante overheid nog onderwerp van het debat was, lijkt de overheid nu vooral de transparante burger als doel na te streven. Ook het bedrijfsleven speelt een belangrijke rol in de toenemende controle op het gedrag van burgers en consumenten. Ontwikkelingen zoals de bewaarplicht verkeersgegevens, de voorgestelde centrale opslag van biometrische gegevens en de centrale opslag van reisgegevens (OV-chipkaart) geven daarbij de toon aan. Burgerrechten en in het bijzonder privacy blijven belangrijke onderwerpen. Het is ook zeker niet zo dat Bits of Freedom stopt omdat op dit terrein niets meer te bereiken valt. Sterker nog, een burgerrechtenbeweging is harder nodig dan ooit. Gelukkig zijn er nog tenminste twee initiatieven die doorgaan in de geest van Bits of Freedom. European Digital Rights, de Europese coalitie van digitale burgerrechten organisaties, zal haar activiteiten gewoon voortzetten. Bits of Freedom was in 2002 &eacute;&eacute;n van de initiatiefnemers voor de oprichting van deze organisatie die zich vooral op lobby-werk in Brussel richt. Ook de Nederlandse Big Brother Awards die elk jaar door Bits of Freedom worden uitgereikt, verdwijnen niet.

{"title":"Awards June 2008","description":"Awards June 2008 The winners of the June 2008 call are: Multi-User Jingle It is intended that MU-Jingle improves over three existing solutions: Jingle -&nbsp;by supporting more than two participants; Skype -&nbsp;by being an open standard with a free software implementation; SIP -&nbsp;by supporting reliable peer-to-peer connectivity, as opposed to requiring dedicated media relay infrastructure, thereby allowing a video stream from each participant without the need for multiplexing. In general, by adding support for multi-user audio/video to XMPP, users do not have to give up the benefits of XMPP in order to make a multi-user call. Authenticating users over the Internet using e-Passports The intention is to create a trustworthy identity solution that allows a user to use their e-passport for authentication at regular websites or webservices (e.g. for e-government like services). Such a solution may contain a browser plug-in that integrates the software developed in JMRTD with an open source identity selector (perhaps compatible with InfoCard). Additionally, the solution may require the establishment of a central server that acts as an identity provider (perhaps compatible with OpenID). A question that will need to be answered is to what degree end-users and service providers need to trust the identity provider (in case of end-users: trust with respect to dealing with privacy sensitive data). ODF for Symbian OS As more and more governments are adopting ODF, some of them even as the unique document format, it is not coherent that there is no freely available, open source viewer for Symbian OS or other mobile systems available. Mobile Office is a reader for OpenDocument files and currently the only implementation of ODF for any mobile device. With Mobile Office, you can now read your files also on your mobile and have them always with you. For the first time ever, it will be possible to read your OpenDocument files from OpenOffice.org, KOffice, AbiWord and Lotus Symphony on your Symbian Smartphone using Open Source software. The following features will be supported: create an appropriate project under e.g Google Code, Sourceforge or others; release Mobile Office's source code under an appropriate license; add end-user documentation about Mobile Office as html and/or pdf pages as well as help content integrated into the application itself; finish up some remaining stuff to make it compatible with some changes done by OpenOffice.org, e.g. in relation to encryption of documents. Additionally NLnet decided to sponsor the following events and activities: Congres Tilting Perspectives on Regulating Technologies This conference aims at bringing academic knowledge and policy approaches about regulating technology a step forward by looking at issues from a multidisciplinary angle.

This project will implement an open source SIP SIMPLE MSRP client that will provide a complete end-user experience for near real-time encrypted text communications and end-to-end file transfer capability over the Internet. This client will replace proprietary applications that user today are usually using on their desktop with one a consolidated open source SIP software and will enable third party applications by the use of an open API. The client will support presence indications and buddy list management, text and file transfer multi-media communication using IETF standards (SIP SIMPLE). UMTSMon. Umtsmon is a program to handle/control 3G mobile network cards and mobile phones from Linux and use them to access the internet in a consumer-friendly way. Results of the project will enable Linux users to use Mobile 3G laptop cards and/or mobile phones (over usb and/or Bluetooth) to connect to the Internet from anywhere (as long as it has network coverage). The major problem with UMTSmon is the wide variety in hardware it has to support. To resolve hardware issue all popular devices will be bought, the incompatibilities will be fixed up, documenting how to work with that particular device will be written. Also testing will be automated and professionalized. Investigation on security of mediaplayers with UPnP. One of the new trends in home entertainment is the use of networked mediaplayers and mediaservers. Many of the mediaplayers use the UPnP A/V protocol to make and distribute of the content. Earlier research has shown that some of UPnP protocols are not securely implemented. Although lots of equipment is being sold now, there was no serious independent research made on their security, while there are known security. The threat model can include: 1) Steeling the content from a MediaServer; 2) Play unrequested content on a mediaplayer (audio/video spamming). These two scenarios are never analysed. The aim of the project is to investigate the most serious and statistically the most often forthcoming security britches in this equipment and to show how easy they can be misused. OpenStreetMap Belgium. OpenStreetMap Belgium is a loosely-knit team of OpenStreetMap International comprised of Belgian volunteers aiming creation of free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways. Openstreetmap Belgium strives to work in close cooperation with volunteer teams around the world, especially in neighbouring countries. There will be 10 GPS data loggers bought, which will be directly used for mapping. FLOSS Manuals Print on Demand services will Integrate the content (Open Source manuals) creation platform with Print on Demand services. This will enable collaborative authoring of manuals online, and the output directly to book form available for purchase via a print on demand service. Many prefer reading reference materials from a book. Hence the wish is to extend and optimise the print-on-demand processes as the current workflow is inefficient and not sustainable. Additionally NLnet decided to sponsor the three day European meeting of GNU project maintainers in Bristol aimed to stimulate continued innovation in GNU software, to provide mutual technical assistance for GNU developers, and to increase distribution security through direct keysigning.

{"title":"Awards","description":"Awards The selected projects within the February 2014 Call are: Uberflow OpenFlow is a simple protocol that allows switching hardware to be unbound from routing decisions. OpenFlow is the de-facto standard protocol for software-defined networking (SDN). The intelligence is moved to a central controller that is responsible for multiple switches in a network. Through OpenFlow, the controller is dynamically notified of flow creations (as with NetFlow and IPFIX), and can respond with actions that are to be taken by switching hardware in the data path: route the flow elsewhere, change fields, etc. This dynamic altering of network state is what makes OpenFlow, and SDN in general, very attractive in a number of fields. The API for manipulating the network state within OpenFlow is currently being standardised by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) as NBI (which stands for 'North-Bound Interface'). As an emerging standard NBI has significant potential to create the ecosystem for network architectures. More about Uberflow SIPcollab Collaborative editing on documents is required (or at least very helpful) in a broad range of use-cases. Collaborative editing capabilities between peers gets rid of the need of server and enables usage in places and circumstances where it was not possible before. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in combination with ZRTP and OTR offers encrypted multimedia (or \"whatever-media\") communication channels between individuals and groups. Common usages include voice and video conferencing, instant messaging (MSRP) and desktop sharing. While the latter technically allows people to present and share documents, it is brittle, bandwidth heavy and broadcast only - meaning that only a single user can edit a document. In order to provide more agile and interactive capabilities, this project adds collaboration facilities based on the collaborative webODF editor and the SIP/SIMPLE client SDK. Multiple users will be able to view and edit a document (such as a presentation or text document) with a group of people in parallel. The project will produce both a simple standalone version based on QML and an integrated version as a plugin to the Blink Qt project. More about SIPcollab Open Crypto Project (cryptech.is) Cryptech.is is a project that want to design an open-source hardware cryptographic engine that can be built by anyone from public hardware specifications and open-source firmware. Anyone can then operate it without fees of any kind. Recent revelations have cast a doubt on the integrity of some of the implementations of basic cryptographic functions and devices used to secure communications on the Internet. There are serious questions about algorithms and about implementations of those algorithms in software and particularly hardware. The algorithmic issues are in the domain of the heavy math cryptography folk. But we must also deal with the implementation issues. The Open Crypto project is pursuing the development of an open-source hardware cryptographic engine that meets the needs of high assurance Internet infrastructure systems that use cryptography. The open-source hardware cryptographic engine must be of general use to the broad Internet community, covering needs such as secure email, web, DNS, PKIs, etc. The project solicits functional requirements from a wide range of organizations. It will focus on the classic low level cryptographic functions and primitives, and not get drawn into re-implementation of application protocol layers.

G.I.S.S. needs to be reshaped to support more channels, for it is now reaching its limits, and several improvments should be developped to make it more reliable and more accessible. The project will focus on the following aspects: improvement of the topology of the network, development of a specific version of icecast, live CD improvement, 'mediabase' archive tool similar to you-tube but using only free software. Additionally a number of workshops will be set up. Improving OpenDocumentFormat support in Koffice. KOffice has long been a strong OpenDocument implementation, the main implementation outside the famous OpenOffice. In KOffice version 2 the text engine has been upgraded to support more features and to support anonymous properties inside the text engine. This project aims to make KWord ready for release based on the new text engine. The upgrade to the new text engine has the effect that large parts of the existing ODF loading need to be adjusted to match. A large part of the work therefor is to make the ODF loading and saving code work equally good, or better compared to the latest stable release; 1.6.3. To reach this goal automated testing using an ODF testsuite will be written based on existing suite of test-documents. Tor anonymity system for low-bandwith users. The Tor anonymity system is currently only usable by internet users who have high-bandwith connections.

{"title":"A Second Start for the NLnet Foundation: Some History","description":"A Second Start for the NLnet Foundation: Some History (By Teus Hagen, Frances Brazier, Wytze van der Raay, and Jos Alsters; The board of the NLnet Foundation) Back in 1982, the first UNIX-network in Europe was presented at the European UNIX Users Group (EUUG) conference in Paris. The centre of the network was located at the CWI, the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, Holland, and was set up by Teus Hagen and Piet Beertema. Piet Beertema, who maintained the UUCP software and the infrastructure, became the expert for a whole generation of network maintainers in Europe. Daniel Karrenberg, also at the CWI, was probably the first in Europe to introduce IP networking in the late eighties. The number of national and international sites connected to the network at the CWI increased significantly, as did the amount of work involved. As a result, the European umbrella part of the network, EUnet, was separated from the Dutch national part of the network, NLnet. The responsibility for NLnet was given to the Dutch UNIX user group NLUUG. Because the NLUUG was (and still is) an association with professional members that primarily organizes conferences, tutorials, and workshops, the increasing financial and operational involvement with the network exploitation soon became an unacceptable risk. To solve this problem, in 1989 the NLUUG founded the Dutch nonprofit organization Stichting NLnet to exploit the Dutch network. The NLnet evolution is in some ways comparable to the evolution of UUNET in the US. The difference lies in the type of organization chosen. The Dutch organizational form `Stichting', literally `Foundation', needs some explanation for non-Dutch readers. Under Dutch law, a `Stichting' is an institutional organization, authorized by law and with a non-profit and somewhat idealistic objective. A `Stichting' does not have members. It has a Board responsible for all of its activities, which legally must be in line with its objective and written regulations. One of the founders of `Stichting NLnet', Ted Lindgreen, has been heavily involved in maintaining and building the network from the start. As the first director of NLnet Holding, he designed and implemented the first national backbone in the Netherlands, using the infrastructure of the Dutch national railway. This was a significant accomplishment for that time. By 1994, it became clear that commercial exploitation of the network needed to be supported by a more appropriate legal structure. To this purpose, NLnet Foundation established NLnet Holding B.V., a commercial company to provide high-quality internet access to both professional and non-professional users. NLnet Holding, which started with 5 employees, has grown into the leading Dutch internet provider and had more than 90 employees at the end of 1997. The Holding has two daughters, NLnet Development and NLnet Services Amsterdam, and has acted as a leading party in several joint ventures, such as InterNLnet, a quality access provider for the consumer market. A year after NLnet Holding was founded, it became clear to the Board of NLnet Foundation that further growth relied heavily on international connectivity. An increasing number of financially stronger competitors were appearing, resulting in competition in the national market and pricing below cost. Co-operation with a strong (both financially and technically) international partner was deemed essential. In 1997, negotiations with UUNET were finalized. During the negotiation phase, UUNET became a daughter of WorldCom. In August 1997, shares were swapped: all NLnet Holding shares were exchanged for a number of WorldCom shares. Until then, the role of NLnet Foundation was that of the shareholder of NLnet Holding B.V. As a result of this transaction, NLnet Foundation became a very small shareholder in WorldCom. The Foundation no longer had any significant influence in NLnet Holding B.V. NLnet Foundation now faces a new challenge: to initiate new","url":"/foundation/history/199804-usenix.html"},

NLnet Holding, the company set up by NLnet Foundation, focused on internet service and backbone provision. At the end of August 1997 the ownership of NLnet Holding was transferred to UUnet. The NLnet Foundation has obtained a position somewhat similar to Advanced Network Services in the US. The NLnet Foundation now faces new challenges. Its position is unique: the Foundation is financially, commercially and governmentally independent. Its original goal \"to stimulate electronic information exchange\" can now be reinstated, with less emphasis on backbone and service provision. The Foundation plans to play its role as a stimulating organization, supporting initiatives for network research, development and software availability in the public domain. Beginning May 1, 1998, two of the Executive Board members will be employed full time by the Foundation. All Board members have been active in UNIX User Groups and UNIX networking for more then ten years and are expecting to be able to use their existing connections with UNIX User Groups (in particular NLUUG and USENIX ) constructively. This article is one example of this relationship; presence at USENIX meetings (e.g. the annual technical conference in New Orleans) is another. One of the internet consortia with which the Foundation is exploring a possible collaboration is the Internet Software Consortium ( ISC ), with respect to its software development activities such as secure DNS. Collaboration with other internet consortia is being explored. The goal of the Foundation is to look for loose ends and ideas, to synchronise activities, and to improve distribution channels (e.g., through collaboration with O' Reilly, RedHat, SuSe, etc.). In addition, initiation of new software projects that can contribute to technology improvements and better electronic information exchange are being pursued. Collaboration with the Dutch Internet Services Providers Association ( NLIP ) is another option being examined, in particular with respect to the role the Foundation could play in Holland as a neutral organisation for alarm and help desks for children porno information events, CERT type of events, and certification organizational help. At the end of this year the Foundation will explore possible collaboration with universities and other non-profit institutes with respect to internet related research and education. In addition, the Foundation is considering collaboration with a number of software development projects, such as: DNS, INN, DHCP, PGP, ISDN4*NIX, sendmail, IMAP, LDAP, etc. Please do not hesitate to approach the Foundation with new suggestions, keeping in mind that the Foundation's involvement must be more than just financial. Last but not least, here is some information about the people involved. The Foundation has four Board members (general director Teus Hagen, financial director Wytze van der Raay, research director Frances Brazier ,&nbsp; and director Jos Alsters ) and an Advisory Board (prof. Paul de Bra, for network technology, Anne-Marie Kemna (KPMG and the University of Leiden) for legal matters, and Erik Esseling (Moret Ernst and Young) for financial affairs). In May the name NLnet Services will no longer exist as such but will be known as UUNET Nederland BV. From then on the Foundation will appear on the net as nlnet.nl.

{"title":"Answer to Community Patent Consultation","description":"Answer to Community Patent Consultation [This is NLnet's official reaction on the Community Patent Consultation by the EU about software patents] Stichting NLnet is a Dutch foundation which works on the advancement of internet technology following a strict Open Source philosophy. NLnet spends between 1 and 2 million euro per year on internet technology innovation, and has a vested interest in keeping all results of its projects freely available for anyone to use, read, modify or redistribute. Section 1 - Basic principles and features of the patent system 1.1 Do you agree that these are the basic features required of the patent system? The most important feature of the patent system is that it must guarantee continued or increased innovation. We do not want to see its expansion in areas where it is counterproductive. For example we do not want to see an expansion of subject matter without clear evidence that this produces better results. In particular we see only disadvantages in allowing patents on software and software protocols. 1.2 Are there other features that you consider important? The patent system is only part of the problem. We would like to see an overall innovation strategy, and more assurance that the patent system produces \"good\" patents, in a way that can be empirically defined. 1.3 How can the Community better take into account the broader public interest? By separating the legislative, judiciary and executive tasks in the patent system, and by making the patent system accessible to society at large, not just specialists. We want to see more innovation, not simply more patents. Our proven way to boost innovation is by means of open source where it is applicable. Patents are witholding innovation and deployment. Section 2 - The Community patent as a priority for the EU 2.1 By comparison with the common political approach, are there any alternative or additional features that you believe an effective Community patent system should offer? The most important point is to separate the executive, legislative and judicial powers which are all currently performed by the EPO to some extent. We really do not want to see the EPO defining community law, bypassing the Commission and Parliament. Section 3 - The European Patent System and in particular the European Patent Litigation Agreement 3.1 What advantages and disadvantages do you think that pan-European litigation arrangements as set out in the draft EPLA would have for those who use and are affected by patents? If the EPLA were to enforce the high-quality patents defined by EPC article 52, this could have a positive impact. If the EPLA were to enforce the EPO TBA case law (and thus enforce software and business method patents), the results would be catastrophic in our opinion. 3.2 Given the possible coexistence of three patent systems in Europe (the national, the Community and the European patent), what in your view would be the ideal patent litigation scheme in Europe? We would want to litigate a Community patent before a Community court, based on Community law made by Community legislators. This court should be independent of any Patent Office. We would want to litigate national patents in national courts. This is convenient in terms of geography, language, and culture. Given that European Patents are more or less collections of national patents, at least the possibility to go to a national court should be kept. Above all we must be able to appeal to a court which is not bound by the case law of the executive (the various patent offices), since such judicial independence is a basic requirement of our justice system. Section 4 - Approximation and mutual recognition of national patents 4.1 What aspects of patent law do you feel give rise to barriers to free movement or distortion of competition because of differences in law or its application in practice between Member States?

AHA! is available from http://aha.win.tue.nl/. AHA!, the Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture, is a general-purpose adaptive Web-based system, completely Open Source and implemented using Java Servlets. It is a fast engine performing adaptive link annotation or hiding and conditional inclusion of fragments. The AHA! site offers a tutorial which is adaptive (using AHA! 2.0 of course). Soon we will be announcing the first previews of AHA! 3.0 which is to be released later this year, when we iron out the bugs to make it fast and stable. If you are thinking of performing research on AH applications, or you want to use AH in applications, but you don't want to develop your own system (which I can assure you is a lot of work!) you should look into AHA!. It may just offer all the features you need, and if not you are free to modify it (and tell us about it). Happy adapting! Paul De Bra and Natasha Stash."},

Brendan Rousseau is a junior researcher working on AHA! for 3 months. David Smits, Barend de Lange and Bart Berden are (full-time) thesis students at TU/e. Tomi Santic is a (full-time) thesis student working at the University of Pittsburgh. Progress (since previous report) up to this date The status of the AHA! project as of February 5, 2003 is described below. It lists the items that have been realized or worked on since the previous progress report. The AHA! 2.0 system is ready to be released in &ldquo;beta&rdquo; version. All planned bug fixes and improvements for 2.0 are ready. The tutorial is being written (and almost ready). The graphical authoring tool developed by Brendan Rousseau is ready (but small suggested improvements will come later). The concept/rule editor has been updated so that it uses the same files (in the same directory) as the graph author. All conversion tools are fully functional (from authoring format to internal XML or mySQL format, and from XML to mySQL and back). Barend de Lange has a demo available of the inclusion of objects/fragments. Fragments are treated as concepts. Their presentation can be controlled through the new conditional inclusion developed by (intern) Monique Ansems. Bart Berden has a demo available of stable presentations, including fully stable presentations and updates that require a &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; in order to be applied. Tomi Santic is working on the inclusion of Interbook functionality into AHA!, with the ultimate goal of replacing Interbook by AHA!. (Interbook is the only other adaptive hypermedia system that is at least as well-known as AHA!.) Koen Aben is finishing his internship work (done at the University of Southampton. He has developed a &ldquo;procedural adaptation language&rdquo; and is completing a compiler from that language to AHA! adaptation rules. Future Milestones until June 30, 2003 Work on AHA! Version 2.0 will continue, and result in a &ldquo;final&rdquo; release. The tutorial being completed is the main test-case for this version. Two students are working on a showcase: the Adaptive Hypertext and Hypermedia Homepage. Completion of this process depends partially on the availability of the new aha.win.tue.nl server (being installed now). Since the AH&amp;H Homepage is visited regularly by the whole adaptive hypermedia community, the whole community will get to experience AHA!. In the period until April 30, 2003, Barend de Lange and Bart Berden will write the main additions for AHA! 3.0: the integration of fragments in the concept structure and the creation of stable presentations. This will imply that the main document format will become XHTML (without any AHA!-specific tags). Barend and Bart will also develop a demo that uses SMIL instead of XHTML. David Smits will start a thesis on the analysis of termination and confluence, and the inclusion of detection into the authoring tools. The work of Tomi Santic includes the presentation of abstract concepts and support for navigating between concepts and pages. This in effect implements page selectors. The work of Barend de Lange includes what we previously described as page constructors. Natasha Stash will work on improvements to the form editor and also write a multiple choice test editor that works in the same way. The period of May 1, 2003 to June 30, 2003 will be used to integrate the tools and the documentation, and to prepare the AHA! 3.0 release. Dissemination of results The following specific actions will be taken to bring AHA! to the public: AHA! 2.0 will be sent to people who have been actively using AHA! in the past, or are using it now.

(pp. 1386-1389) A talk/demo was given on AHA! 2.0 at the Open Source mini-conference that preceeded the yearly dutch SGML/XML conference. An intern, Koen Aben, is working with Dave Millard from the University of Southampton on new ideas for AHA! and Auld Linky, and a new specification language for adaptation. Auld Linky is an Open Hypermedia engine. It can conditionally include links in documents by using link bases. (The documents themselves do not contain links.) AHA! can be used to conditionally annotate the links, and also to conditionally include or hide fragments. Koen Aben is working on a new language for describing the possible adaptation in an application. The language resembles a procedural language and can be used to describe both link adaptation and page construction. A thesis student, Tomi Santic, is working with Peter Brusilovsky from the University of Pittsburgh on integrating ideas from AHA! and Interbook. Interbook is a well-known adaptive educational hypermedia system that concentrates on link adaptation and adaptive guidance.

{"title":"AHA! Adaptive Hypermedia for All, project proposal","description":"AHA! Adaptive Hypermedia for All, project proposal Prof. dr. P.M.E. De Bra Abstract The purpose of the AHA project is to define, study and implement a facility for extending Web-servers with transparent adaptivity functionality. A Web-server is extended with a (servlet) module that registers users automatically, maintains a detailed user profile and adapts the delivered information and the link structure, based on that user profile. This server-side extension is generic, i.e. application independent, and open, meaning that the source of the information may itself be external to the server running the adaptive engine. More concretely the AHA project consists of two phases of one year each, with two people working in parallel. The funding of the second year shall depend on the outcome of the first year. The goals (research and development) of the two phases are: Phase 1: Design and development of a generic, open, adaptive engine, building on the current AHA prototype (for more information see http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~debra/ ). The extensions include the ability to perform adaptation on documents from an external source, the ability to handle (and link to) composite objects, and better authoring support. Phase 2: Extending the design and implementation to allow richer user-models (with arbitrary attributes and value-domains), while maintaining desirable properties such as termination and confluence. A second extension will be the ability to define page constructors, i.e. ways to dynamically construct pages out of sets of information fragments. The authoring environment will also be extended to include support for these richer user models and page constructors. The research results will be published in national and international conferences and journals. The software will be published on Internet and distributed as open source, using the GNU licensing scheme. After completion of the first phase we shall start actively promoting the use of AHA for applications in education, electronic commerce and corporate websites. Background and History Adaptive hypermedia is a recent research and development area [ Brusilovsky, 1996 ]. It bundles research efforts in the area of user modeling, adaptive systems and hypermedia. While the first adaptive hypermedia systems (including our own first development [ Van Ginderen, 1990 ]) were not Web-based, most of the current generation adaptive hypermedia systems do employ World Wide Web technology. Two noteworthy systems are Interbook [ Brusilovsky et al., 1996 ] and AHA [ De Bra et al, 1998 ]. The former is developed specifically for electronic textbooks and learning environments. The latter also started out as an educational system [ Calvi et al, 1997 ]. A first step has been taken to converting AHA into a general-purpose adaptive hypermedia system, by no longer enforcing a &quot;monotonely increasing knowledge&quot; model, which is typical for educational applications. The AHA project continues this process towards a more widely usable adaptive hypermedia system, by investigating several extensions such as the use of composite objects, external information sources, richer user-models, and flexible page constructors. A lot of effort will go into the development of authoring support, to ensure the usability of AHA for creating adaptive Web-based applications. Some theoretical research is also needed to investigate how the planned extensions can be realized without sacrificing desirable properties of the adaptive engine, such as termination and confluence. Different experimental versions, dating back to 1996, have led to the AHA system in its current form: In the first version of AHA the author could specify conditions (in terms of pages that were previously read by the user) for hypertext links to become available to the user. Thus, users were prevented from jumping to pages for which they were lacking some prerequisite knowledge (according to the author's definition). AHA was implemented using","url":"/project/aha/200106-aha-proposal.html"},

The AGFL formalism for the syntactic description of Natural Languages has been developed by the Department of Software Engineering, University of Nijmegen. It is a formalism in which large context free grammars can be described in a compact way. AGFLs belong to the family of two level grammars, along with attribute grammars: a first, context-free level is augmented with set-valued features for expressing agreement between parts of speech. The AGFL parser generation system for Natural Languages generates efficient parsers from AGFL grammars. It includes a lexicon system that is suitable for the large lexica needed in real life NLP applications. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology for future web-based applications: from filtering and narrowcasting to more intelligent search machines and services based on the automatic interpretation of the contents of documents. The state-of-the-art in search machines on the web is based mainly on the use of keywords and applying linguistic techniques to enhance recall. An example is the Linguistix software library, incorporated in commercial search machines like Altavista and Askjeeves, which performs tagging, lemmatization and fuzzy semantic matching. Besides individual keywords, some use is also made of phrases, but this is mostly limited to those noun phrases which can easily be extracted. An important step forward in precision is to be expected from the use of more complicated linguistic phrases, including the verb phrase. Progress in this respect is hampered by the lack of parsers for natural languages, which can extract and normalize all phrases suitable for Information Retrieval applications with sufficient speed and precision. Present day natural language parsing technologies are still of limited value to applications: most sophisticated parsers have been developed for mechanical translation rather than for retrieval purposes most parsers are developed using proprietary software, and few are in the public domain, so there is little synergy between projects; parsing speeds are generally low in relation to the speed of the Internet. That is why there is a need for tools that are available in the public domain, and suitable for the development of efficient parsers for Information Retrieval applications. The AGFL system is such a tool."},

The contribution will be used to cover expenses for a serious independent security audit, which will establish the trustworthiness of its infrastructure. A completed audit enables CAcert to petition Mozilla for addition to their browsers and other software. This, if approved, will result in a dramatic increase in the utility of the certificates to all users in the community and the public at large. As the approach of CAcert's audit work-through has been fundamentally open and honest, the result is also likely to challenge the entire CA industry to lift its game.

Wisper network infrastructure consists of low cost wifi boxes. The wifi hardware should be able to operate on long distance wifi, typically up to 10 miles. The boxes operate with a standard (embedded) Open Source Operation System like Linux or BSD OS. Probably, the network software will organize a mesh type of connectivity, like MIT Research's RoofNet project (however, the scaling bandwidth problem needs to be solved first). Wisper wifi boxes should be able to join an existing Wisper cloud fully automatically and the network should scale well. Similar to indoor mesh type of boxes, like the MeshCube (running on NyLon OSS software), Meraki (running on Linux 2.4), and closely related to Meraki RoofNet Cambridge MA (USA) regional wifi access (running on OpenWRT and standard wifi routing boxes).

{"description":"Third Discussion Draft GPLv3 BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA --Wednesday, March 28, 2007-- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today released the third discussion draft for version 3 of the most widely used free software license, the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). Today's draft incorporates the feedback received from the general public, official discussion committees, and two international conferences held in India and Japan. Many significant changes have been made since the previous draft, released in July 2006. In recognition of this fact, the FSF now plans to publish one additional draft before the final text of GPL version 3. Changes in this draft include: First-time violators can have their license automatically restored if they remedy the problem within thirty days. License compatibility terms have been simplified, with the goal of making them easier to understand and administer. Manufacturers who include the software in consumer products must also provide installation information for the software along with the source. This change provides more narrow focus for requirements that were proposed in previous drafts. New patent requirements have been added to prevent distributors from colluding with patent holders to provide discriminatory protection from patents. Richard Stallman, president of the FSF and principal author of the GNU GPL, said, \"The GPL was designed to ensure that all users of a program receive the four essential freedoms which define free software. These freedoms allow you to run the program as you see fit, study and adapt it for your own purposes, redistribute copies to help your neighbor, and release your improvements to the public. The recent patent agreement between Microsoft and Novell aims to undermine these freedoms. In this draft we have worked hard to prevent such deals from making a mockery of free software.\" Today's draft will be open for discussion for sixty days. The FSF will solicit input in a wide array of public venues and make changes as needed in response. After this period, it will release a last call draft, followed by another thirty days for discussion before the FSF's board of directors approves the final text of GPL version 3. More information about this draft is available at http://gplv3.fsf.org, including the full text, detailed explanations of the latest changes, and new plans for finalizing the license. As with the previous drafts, the FSF encourages community members to provide feedback on the new draft at this site. About the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) The GNU GPL is the most widely used free software license worldwide: almost three quarters of all free software packages are distributed under this license. It is not, however, the only free software license. Richard Stallman wrote the version 1 and 2 of the GNU GPL with legal advice from Perkins, Smith &amp; Cohen. Version 1 was released in 1989, and version 2 in 1991. Since 1991, free software use has increased tremendously, and computing practices have changed, introducing new opportunities and new threats. In 2005, Stallman began revising the GPL for version 3. In January 2006, the FSF began a systematic process of public review and feedback, with legal advice and organizational support from the Software Freedom Law Center. About the GNU Operating System and Linux Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only operating system developed specifically for the sake of users' freedom. See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html. In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see","url":"/project/gpl3/20070328-draft3-announce.html","title":"Third Discussion Draft GPLv3"},

Teams of 2 to 3 students supported by 1 to 3 coaches are creating educational websites. They are competing with their entry for one of many prizes (over 1 million USD in scholarships and awards). ThinkQuest was created by the US organisation Advanced Network & Services Inc. In 1996, ThinkQuest was organized for the first time as a national American contest. In 1997, ThinkQuest was launched as an international contest. To simplify the organisation of ThinkQuest world wide, Advanced has created so-called National Partners. National Partners (NP) are organizations cooperating with Advanced, which introduce, stimulate and support ThinkQuest in their own country. In 1997, SURFnet took upon itself the National Partnership for ThinkQuest in the Netherlands. In the first years, SURFnet has established ThinkQuest in the Netherlands and gained valuable experiences with the organization, supported by a few distinguished sponsors (KPN Telecom, the Ministry of Education, Kennisnet and Educatiefnet). To establish a somewhat more permanent platform for the expansion of ThinkQuest, SURFnet and Stichting NLnet have set up a new foundation, Stichting ThinkQuest Nederland. Together with the Dutch Ministry of Education, the three partners have provided the new foundation with NLG&nbsp;1,500,000 for the next four years. In the year 2000, ThinkQuest Nederland will expand the contest program with two new contests in addition to the existing ThinkQuest Internet Challenge contest: ThinkQuest-Junior,for pupils in group 6, 7 and 8 of the primary school; ThinkQuest-BVE, for students in BVE (professional and adult education). In subsequent years, additional programs will be launched, as allowed by additional funding from external sponsors.","title":"ThinkQuest; Description","url":"/project/thinkquest/description.html"},

Een groot aantal maatschappelijke organisaties en bedrijven hebben in een open brief aan Minister-president Balkenende (PDF) en de Ministers De Graaf en Brinkhorst hun bezorgdheid geuit over de exclusieve onderhandelingen van de overheid met Microsoft over een megacontract ter waarde van 147 miljoen euro. De organisaties, waaronder de Consumentenbond, Internet Society Nederland, Nederland Kennisland en Novell Nederland, reageren op perspublicaties waaruit blijkt dat de Rijksoverheid en enkele gemeenten op het punt staan een contract af te sluiten voor 245.000 desktops en server software met Microsoft. De organisaties zetten vraagtekens bij het ontbreken van een openbare aanbesteding voor een dergelijk groot contract. De organisaties maken zich zorgen over de negatieve effecten die een dergelijk contract heeft op de softwaremarkt en het innovatieklimaat in Nederland. Tevens is een dergelijk contract in strijd met door het Kabinet vastgesteld beleid ten aanzien van het gebruik van open standaarden en open source bij de overheid en het streven de overheid minder afhankelijk te maken van een enkele software leverancier. Bovendien is Microsoft door de Europese Commissie nu juist veroordeeld wegens de gebrekkige interoperabiliteit van haar server software. De Tweede Kamer heeft zich in 2002 unaniem uitgesproken voor de motie Vendrik waarin de regering werd gevraagd concentraties in de softwaremarkt tegen te gaan, ervoor te zorgen dat in 2006 alle door de publieke sector gebruikte software aan open standaarden voldoet. De onderhandelingen met Microsoft staan haaks op deze doelstellingen en leiden ertoe dat de komende vijf jaar de deur op slot gaat bij de overheid ten aanzien van de toepassing van open standaarden, vrije software en open source software.","url":"/project/bof/20041213-microsoft.html","title":"Tegen megacontract Microsoft"},
{"description":"Stichting TQ-NL subsidieert innovatief onderwijs Stichting TQ-NL heeft op 9 januari haar nieuwe website gelanceerd. Op deze website nodigt zij scholen voor basis- en voortgezet onderwijs uit om een voorstel in te dienen voor een (ict)project dat innovatief is in onderwijskundig opzicht en leidt tot verrijking, verandering, vernieuwing of verbreding van het onderwijs. Geselecteerde projecten kunnen maximaal &euro;25.000,- subsidie ontvangen. Stichting TQ-NL is voortgekomen uit Stichting ThinkQuest Nederland, de organisatie die van 1999 tot 2002 de ThinkQuest web-strijden heeft georganiseerd. Doelstelling van de stichting is het stimuleren van innovatieve internet-activiteiten en --initiatieven die het Nederlandse onderwijs ten goede komen. Stichting TQ-NL stelt zich ten doel om de komende 3 jaar jaarlijks 6 projecten te subsidi\\xEBren die bijdragen aan innovaties in het onderwijs. Gezamenlijk en innovatief gebruik van ict moet een belangrijk onderdeel zijn van de ingediende projectvoorstellen, bijv. het gebruik van het internet of een andere manier om elektronisch gegevens uit te wisselen, zoals via GPS of mobiele telefonie. In de projecten moeten leerlingen een belangrijke rol spelen. De ingediende projectvoorstellen mogen risicovol zijn, dat wil zeggen dat ook voorstellen ingediend mogen worden waarvan het niet zeker is of de uitwerking succesvol zal zijn. Bijzonder is dat bij de beslissing welke aanvragen gehonoreerd worden, leerlingen uit het primair en voortgezet onderwijs het bestuur van Stichting TQ-NL zullen adviseren. Op basis van deze adviezen zal het bestuur beslissen welke idee&euml;n nader uitgewerkt kunnen worden om in aanmerking te komen voor subsidie. Met ingang van het schooljaar 2006-2007 zullen de projecten uitgevoerd worden. Aan het eind van dat schooljaar wordt een afsluitend evenement georganiseerd waar alle door Stichting TQ-NL gesubsidieerde projecten hun resultaten presenteren. Aanvragen voor de subsidieronde 2006/2007 moeten worden ingediend v&oacute;&oacute;r 1 maart 2006 via het aanvraagformulier dat is te vinden op de website van Stichting TQ-NL.

{"description":"SIRS; description [Scalable Internet Resource Service -- concluded on 2002/02] Experiences with overloaded networks as a result of the distribution of popular software packages via public ftp servers were the reason for discussion with prof. dr. Andy Tanenbaum and dr. Maarten van Steen of the Computer Systems Group in the Division Mathematics and Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This group does fundamental and applied research in the area of distributed systems. Globe, a world-wide distributed system which supports the distribution and replication of objects, is the focus of the research of the group. Within the scope of Globe, a project named S calable I nternet R esource Service (SIRS) has been defined. The essence of the SIRS-implementation is the encapsulation of a resource (i.e. one or more files) in a Globe distributed object, and subsequently the addition of the most applicable replication and distribution strategy to that object. The development of the necessary adaptations to servers and clients is the main topic of the first part of the SIRS project. The SIRS-1 project started on December 1, 1998, and its first phase ran until December 1, 1999. The costs of the first phase, &euro;&nbsp;68.067, were fully subsidised by Stichting NLnet. The results of this first phase were still very much in the alpha stage, but were promising enough to follow up the project with a second phase named SIRS-2, which ran from December 1, 1999 until December 1, 2000. This second phase consisted of two sub-projects: SIRS/Server, a direct continuation of the SIRS-1 development, and SIRS/GDN, the Globe Distribution Network, a practical application of Globe for the (worldwide) distribution of files, in particular freeware and shareware. The costs of SIRS-2, &euro;&nbsp;142.941, have been fully subsided again by Stichting NLnet. SIRS-3 has been defined as the third phase of the SIRS project. Its purpose was to address a number of important issues in the prototype version resulting from SIRS-2, namely security, fault tolerance and management tools. The project plan for SIRS-3 describes these in more detail. This last phase of SIRS ran from 1 January 2001 until 1 February 2002.

The tutorial starts with a basic introduction into RDF and the Sesame framework. Next, an introduction into the use RDF query languages like SeRQL and SPARQL will be given, after which attendees can get hands-on experience by means of some simple excercises. We then shift focus on the use of the Sesame framework as part of application development, highlighting features of the API, and the way in which to communicate with the system either locally or remotely. We move on to introduce Elmo, a set of tools and Java Beans for cross-use ontologies such as FOAF, and in the final session we will discuss scalable OWL reasoning in Sesame using OWLIM. The goal of the tutorial is to make researchers and developers aware of the advantages of using the Sesame framework for their own development work, and giving them the knowledge to get started quickly with using Sesame effectively.

{"description":"Second Discussion Draft GPLv3 Released Second Discussion Draft of Revised GNU General Public License Released Six-Month International Review Process Leads to Revisions and Clarifications BOSTON and NEW YORK, July 27, 2006 --&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) today have released the second discussion draft of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 (GPLv3). This new draft marks the middle of a year-long public review process designed to evaluate proposed changes and to finalize a new version of the GPL. The GNU GPL is the most widely used free software license worldwide: almost three quarters of all free software programs (also known as \"Free/Libre and Open Source Software\", or FLOSS) are distributed under this license. Since the GPL's last revision more than 15 years ago, free software development, distribution, and use have changed tremendously. Since the release of the initial GPLv3 discussion draft in January, members of the free software community have submitted nearly one thousand suggestions for improvement. Many have continued the discussion at international GPLv3 conferences held in the United States, Brazil, and Spain. With the help of discussion committees, the Free Software Foundation and the Software Freedom Law Center have considered all the issues raised by public comments. The new draft of GPLv3 contains extensive revisions in light of these comments. \"We have considered each suggestion with care,\" said Eben Moglen, founder and Chairman of the Software Freedom Law Center, which represents various free software projects and is assisting FSF in revising the new license. \"By listening to people from around the world, we are working toward a license that acts consistently in many different legal systems and in a variety of situations.\" \"The primary purpose of the GNU GPL is to preserve users' freedom to use, share, and modify free software,\" said Richard Stallman, founder of FSF and original author of the GPL. \"We depend on public review to make the GPL do this job reliably.\" About the Revisions The new draft clarifies that the license only directly restricts DRM in the special case in which it is used to prevent people from sharing or modifying GPLv3-covered software. The clarified DRM section preserves the spirit of the original GPL, which forbids adding additional unfree restrictions to free software. GPLv3 does not prohibit the implementation of DRM features, but prevents them from being imposed on users in a way that they cannot remove. Other significant revisions in the new draft include a reworked license compatibility section, and provisions that specifically allow GPL-covered programs to be distributed on certain file sharing networks such as BitTorrent. Additionally, this release includes the first draft of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3. The LGPL license covers many free software system libraries, including some published by the Free Software Foundation. The text of the new GPL and LGPL drafts can be found on the web at http://gplv3.fsf.org. The site also includes audio commentary from Eben Moglen; a rationale document which describes the changes to the new draft; and further information about the GPLv3 revision process. As with the first draft, community members are encouraged to submit comments online. Throughout the remainder of the process, there will continue to be international GPLv3 discussion conferences, including one next month in Bangalore, India. A third discussion draft of GPLv3 is expected to be released this fall, and the final version will be released between January and March of 2007. \"Last November, we published a document which outlined the process for drafting the new GPL,\" said Eben Moglen, chair of SFLC. \"As of now, we are still on schedule for a final release in early 2007.\"","title":"Second Discussion Draft GPLv3 Released","url":"/project/gpl3/20060727-draft2-announce.html"},

{"description":"Release plans, July 31, 2003 The following message was posted on the Sesame mailinglist. It predicts the features of the upcoming Sesame development releases. Dear Sesame-interested, In preparation for the release of Sesame 1.0, we have set out a time line for the next releases, and identified what each release will be about. All dates mentioned are estimates. August 13: Sesame 0.95 - the API-revision release Main features of this release: Revision of the RDF model classes This revision will better reflect the current understanding of the RDF datamodel, including an explicit distinction between BNodes and URIs. Revision of the SAIL API The SAIL API is being revised in a number of ways, making it more usable, faster, more stable, and more generically applicable. Full details available in the Sesame-devel mailinglist archive or upon request. Custom inferencer Developed by OntoText, an inferencer that allows the user to specify his own entailment rules. This enables domain-specific inferencing, as well as partial support for OWL Lite. RDF Model Theory Inferencer for in-memory Sail Implementation of database query-forwarding in RDBMS Sail Query forwarding allows significant performance gains in query evaluation. Significant meaning anything between 100%-400%. Removal of deprecated SQL92Sail from codebase Since release 0.8 the SQL92Sail has been made obsolete by the RDBMS Sail. The SQL92Sail code will be removed from Sesame. August 20: RIO - Sesame Parser Release RIO (RDF I/O) is Sesame's own RDF parser/writer package. Since release 0.7 this has already been the default parser, and now we are releasing it as a seperate software package to be used independently of Sesame. September 10: Sesame 0.96 - the SeRQL release Main features of this release: SeRQL: optional path expressions With optional path expressions it becomes possible to query for property values that may not always have a defined value for certain instances. SeRQL: RDF Schema support Several RDF Schema primitives will be explicitly supported by functions. SeRQL: several improvements in expressiveness and syntax: nested queries and RDF syntax for queries. October 1: Sesame 0.97 - the integration release Revision of the communication protocols Client API that is transparent w.r.t. the protocol being used The revised client API will allow transparent access to Sesame from client code. Developers can easily switch between HTTP, SOAP, RMI, or direct use of Sesame as a library. The API will also be more expressive, allowing direct access to SAIL methods. Extended functionality for in-memory RDF model manipulation Finalized user &amp; developer documentation October 10-30: Sesame 1.0 RC1..n Extensive testing and bugfixing October 30: Sesame 1.0 All APIs stable As always, we welcome your comments and/or questions.

{"description":"Proposal for Lire-2.0 related development This document can serve as the basic of a sponsorship request to NLnet for more Lire development. It is made of 4 parts. The first one discusses the two different audience of Lire. The second part lists the features for which the sponsorship is requested. The benefits of these features is discussed in the light of the two Lire audience. The third section discusses man-power availability for this development. Finally, the fourth section discuss how the schedule and release management could be done. Audience for 2.0 development I think that the Lire audience is made of two classes of users. (As a side note, it will be important to keep this in mind while designing the user survey. At least to try to verify this hypothesis) We could also say that there are two Lire. Lire - The Log Analyser This first class of users sees Lire as an application which can generate reports for a lot of log formats. What these people are interested in is: Support for more log formats. Better support for existing ones. Good default reports. Tools to make it easier to configure Lire. Better output formats. I think that most of current Lire users fall into this group. Lire - The Log Analysis Toolkit This second usage patterns is less concerned about the default reports or the supported log formats but more interested in using Lire as a toolkit. That is a set of tools that can be easily integrated in a custom deployment situation. The people are interested in: Clean API which makes it straightforward to integrate and extend Lire. Documentation on how to integrate Lire. Good output formats. Better reporting functionalities. We have few users of this kind, but they are the ones making the most contributions to Lire: Sun, MavEtJu, No&euml;l Bardelot (that's the one integrating Lire into Cyber Sentry). This was also the important use case for the NFB project and future consultation gigs. Complementary Areas Of course, there are areas of interest to both audiences. One of these would be performance. It could also be argued that the first use case is a specific customisation of the toolkit. I've selected features that appeal to both class of users or that appealed to the toolkit's users. If the Board feels that it would be a better strategy to focus on the \"Log Analyser\" case, I could modify that feature list in consequence. Features discussion Each feature starts by a discussion on what should be the scope of the implementation. When possible, an initial breakdown of the tasks involved in implementing that features are given. After that comes an estimate of the amount of development days estimated to implement the feature. The estimate are done without dependencies. That is, it is done by estimating the amount of work needed to add that feature to the current source tree without adding nothing else. This will make it easier for release management as the features can be added in any order. After that comes a discussion of the benefits of adding that feature. The benefits are discussed from the point of view of the two class of users previously identified. Finally, risks related to that feature are discussed. If possible, a risk-avoidance strategy will be proposed. SQLite Based Report Generation This feature is about re-implementing the report generation component to use SQLite as the query engine. I've sent an email to the development list with ideas on how to implement that feature. Tasks Implement DLFQuery and DlfResult. Map Lire::FilterExpr to SQL. Implement Group, Timegroup, Timeslot, Rangegroup, Records, Min, Max, First, Last, Count, Avg, Sum using DlfQuery and DlfResult. Estimate: 15 days. Benefits: I think that if only one feature should be implemented, this should be the one, as this should bring a considerable performance improvement. Performance improvements will appeal to both class of users. From a development point of view, this will also move some of the complexity outside of Lire.

{"description":"Progress report February 2003 Work on Agide continued Agide is the A-A-P GUI IDE. Most of February was spend on designing and implementing the core of Agide. This progressed mostly as planned. What has been implemented now: Project support through a recipe: Reading a recipe and presenting recognized items to the user. Adding, renaming and deleting items in the project. This is mostly restricted to the IDE-specific variables that start with IDE_. Writing the updated IDE_ items to the recipe. This is just the minimum to be able to work with projects. Plugin mechanism for tools: Various tool plugins can be dropped in the Tools directory. They offer properties that makes it possible to select one for performing an operation. Added tools to edit, search, debug a program and view an image. Implemented mechanisms for inter-tool communication. For example, the search tool presents a list of matches. When clicking on a match an editor tool is opened at the right position. This is done in such a way that the search tool doesn't know about the editor tool. Boa code was hardly used. The lack of comments in the code and the interconnected structure makes it difficult to take a piece of code and use it separately. For example, the tree view uses icons, which are loaded by importing all the modules. Whether any Boa code will be used later depends on whether the Boa author is willing to help out. This is not required for implementing Agide, but it would be very good to work together. Using wxPython for the GUI toolkit has not given any problems. All the GUI code was made to work properly in a reasonable amount of time. There is still one unresolved problem (first opening an editor and then the debugger causes a hang), but it's not clear if this is a problem with wxPython. It's worked around by closing the editor before starting the debugger. To be solved when someone can find out where the hang occurs. The current state of Agide is almost ready for a first public appearance. It is possible to start a project, build it, run the gdb debugger on the produced binary and step through it while displaying the source code in gvim. Although the features are still very limited, a few essential items have been implemented to verify the mechanism for communication between tools is working properly. For example, when the debugger is at a breakpoint and the mouse pointer is positioned over a variable, the value of the variable is displayed in a popup window. This requires the editor to send the text under the pointer to Agide, which passes it on to the debugger. The debugger evaluates the text and sends the result (if any) back to Agide, which passes it on to the editor. This communication is asynchronous and involves communicating with gdb and gvim, which are running as separate programs. Now that this is working it will not be difficult for someone to add another feature. FOSDEM The \"Free and Open source Software Developers Meeting\" was attended. This was a free (as in \"free beer\", even though the beer wasn't free...) event that attacted many students. Many developers were there, most noticable Linux, KDE and Gnome. There was no presentation for A-A-P, but I handed out leaflets with information. I had discussions with several people. Remarks varied from \"Glad that finally someone makes this\" to \"Don't need it\". The remark about building shared libraries also popped up again. This would be a good one to make an example for. Progress Almost four weeks were spend on the GUI IDE. This means the planned time for this work package is almost used up. Some work is still to be done and the first public release will probably reveal things that need to be fixed. Coming month Agide will be made ready for release. A lot of cleaning up is to be done. Mostly to avoid that messages are going to the terminal where Agide was started, these should be displayed in a console window. The release will also require writing a tutorial and announcements.

{"description":"Progress report April 2003 By Bram Moolenaar, May 1 2003 Automatic package install When Aap is about to use the \"scp\" program to copy a file, it will now check that this command is available. If it isn't, a recipe is downloaded from the A-A-P website and executed. This should then install a \"scp\" command that is usable on the current system. The same is done for \"cvs\". This work is part of the \"Recipe Finder\" work package in the plan. The goal is to provide a very easy to use mechanism to install a package that is required in a recipe. The mechanism is working now, but only a couple of packages are available. More can be added easily. I have written a chapter about this in the documentation. You can read it on-line. Installing a package may require root privileges. The \":asroot\" command has been added for this. It runs a separate shell as root, so that the root password only needs to be typed once. Every executed command has to be confirmed by the user for safety. A few more commands have been added to make it easy to write a package recipe. The \"ask_prefix()\" function asks the user where he wants to install the package and whether this is to be done as root. For BSD sytems the port mechanism is used, if possible. Other generic mechanisms (e.g., using RPM on RedHat) are to be added later. This must be done by someone who can test if it works. On the A-A-P website a simple PHP script is used to retrieve the requested recipe. This hides the fact that the recipes are stored as plain files on the web server. This can be changed later to provide something more advanced (e.g., to allow each maintainer to update his recipes or to retrieve a specific version of a package). Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to make a recipe to install \"scp\" on an arbitrary Unix system. This is not a matter of downloading an archive, unpacking and building it. Hopefully someone will make this work! AAP features A number of features have been added that can best be described as \"automake\" mechanisms. Most notably the idea of using $SOURCE and $TARGET has been dropped in favor of the \":program\" command. This is a much simpler mechanism and more flexible as well. The user no longer has to add $EXESUF and is able to specify two or more programs to be build in exactly the same way. Support for building static and shared libraries has been added in the form of the \":lib\" and \":dll\" commands. They are very similar to \":program\". Also, support for yacc and lex has been added. This allows mixing various kinds of files for the \":program\", \":lib\" and \":dll\" commands to have them build and linked together automatically. For flexibility the \":route\" command is used to specify how one filetype can be made into another filetype. More targets are now generated automatically: \"clean\", \"install\", \"uninstall\" and \"cleanALL\". This means that a recipe with just one line can be used to specify building, installing, uninstalling and cleaning up. Example: :program foobar: foo.c bar.y The recipe examples have been updated to use the new mechanism. The result is that they have become quite a bit simpler. One important thing from \"automake\" that is still missing is \"autoconf\" functionality. Joerg Beyer has promised to look into this. Various Design decision 9 \"Format to use for configuration scripts\" has been updated. The choice is not to use a separate file format but to use the recipe for configuration. Several user scopes can now be used for a dependency. Previously the last one defined overruled the others. Added \":cd\", \":chdir\", \":pushdir\" and \":popdir\" commands (mostly by Steve Howe). Added the \":tree\" command: Select files and directories in a tree and execute commands for them. A bit like the Unix \"find\" command. Support $DEBUG, $OPTIMIZE, $INCLUDE and $LIBS for a portable way to specify arguments to the C compiler. Added $TOPDIR, $CHILDDIR, topdir() and childdir(). Makes it easy to pass file names from a child to a parent or toplevel recipe. Added the aap_has()","title":"Progress report April 2003","url":"/project/a-a-p/200304-progress.html"},
{"description":"Progess report June 2005 Ambulant version 1.4 In May, 2005, the Ambulant project released version 1.4 of the Ambulant Open SMIL player. This version is the first public implementation of the new W3C SMIL 2.1CR recommendation for Mobile multimedia players. The Ambulant implementation was used as the basis of the W3C's interoperability testing of the new SMIL standard: Ambulant implements all of the new language extensions and remains the most complete SMIL player available anywhere. The Ambulant player is available for Linux, Mac OS X, Win32, Win32 Tablet, and WinCE. Daisy Talking Book In May, the Ambulant team also participated in a meeting with the Daisy Consortium on the development of a player for the new Daisy Talking Book standard (DTB). The DTB is the main vehicle for delivering content to blind and dyslexic readers worldwide. This summer, the Ambulant player core will be integrated with the AMIS DTB reader to better serve the needs of blind users who want access to complex multimedia content. Holland Open Source Conference The Ambulant group provided two presentations at the recent Holland Open Source Conference in Amsterdam: one presentation provided our vision for converging media platform support and the other provided a set of SMIL examples that showcased the facilities of the Ambulant platform. The group, via our research institute CWI, have been busy integrating Ambulant in a number of external projects. More on these results in a future report. Plans for the near future The next Ambulant release is expected in September. At that time, we expect to deliver media extensions for better video support on Linux and PocketPC systems and we expect to provide a full public test suite for the various SMIL Mobile and Desktop profiles. We also hope to have an initial release of a Symbian SMIL player at that time.","title":"Progess report June 2005","url":"/project/ambulant/20050609-status.html"},
{"description":"Parrot Status Update In July and August, we had our monthly releases of Parrot, 0.4.14 and 0.4.15. There were various language updates, but one of these deserves special mention. The 0.4.15 release included an implementation of \"Not Quite Perl\". This language implements a subset of the full Perl&nbsp;6 feature set, and will be used within the compiler tools for all languages running on Parrot, and as a way to bootstrap a complete Perl&nbsp;6 implementation. The 0.4.14 release included a lot of code cleanup, correcting problems found by automated tools such as lint. 0.4.15 included a refactoring of the configuration system. On the design side, the Object (PDD15) and PMC designs (PDD17) have both received some updates, and 0.4.15 included more implementation work on the object metamodel as described in the object design. Allison Randal led a one-day Parrot hackathon at the recent YAPC::EU conference in Vienna. At the hackathon they provided training to new Parrot developers, prototyped the next stage of development for Parrot's Tree Grammar Engine, planned the steps for finishing off milestone 3 for the OO subsystem, and made valuable progress on bug ticket review and resolution. Allison has also created a schedule for completing the remainder of the first two Parrot milestones. To further this work, she will be working Parrot full-time through December, and half-time next year. The first deadline on this schedule was for the completion of the PMC design by September 15, which Allison has reached. As a director of the Perl Foundation, Allison is not eligible for direct grant payments. Instead, the grant payment for the PMC design work will go to purchase a development machine for her to use while working on Parrot.

{"description":"Parrot Project Status May and June [2007] saw the usual monthly releases of Parrot, 0.4.12 and 0.4.13. Between these two releases, there were numerous language updates, including PHP and Lisp. On the Perl&nbsp;6 front, 0.4.13 was the first release where Parrot passed the Perl&nbsp;6 sanity tests. This is an exciting achievement, because it means that Parrot supports enough of Perl&nbsp;6 that the developers can start using Perl&nbsp;6 to bootstrap its own implementation. More recently, Parrot 0.4.15 \"Augean Stable\" got released, where lots of code review was made, many bugs were fixed, some languages added (NQP, a very lightweight Perl&nbsp;6-like language), significant improvements and refactors to the PCT (Parrot Compiler Toolkit) included, and necessary documentation updates. There were also many improvements to the Parrot internals, notably on the object implementation, as well as smaller improvements in the garbage collector, memory leak fixing, and general cleanup. The object work focused on implementing the new object metamodel documented in PDD15 and switching current object code to this new metamodel. On the design side, there was significant work on the design for PMCs (PDD17). Parrot had a strong presence at the recent YAPC::NA conference in Houston, TX. There was almost a full day of talks devoted to Parrot, including presentations by chromatic, project manager Will Coleda, Patrick Michaud, and Parrot architect Allison Randal.","title":"Parrot Project Status","url":"/project/parrot/20070914-progress.html"},
{"description":"Opinion about NoScript plugin affairs [2009/05/06] NLnet funds a significant number of projects, some of which provide very important functionality to end users. In many cases projects depend on other financial means as well, as we provide highly targeted funding rather than blanket funding. In some cases additional income involves web advertising models, which may be invasive to peoples privacy if no adequate measures are taken. More and more people are starting to take such measures, which puts pressure on funding. This may be challenging, certainly if one has the power to override these measures. Recently, it came to light that one of the projects which receive funding from NLnet --the people responsible for coding the quintessential browser plugin NoScript-- crossed that line. It made the regrettable move to take invasive countermeasures against another plugin that blocks advertisements, which can be regarded as (hacker)ethically irresponsible. Since NoScript itself also functions as an advertisment blocker for websites that uses Javascript to draw iframes with advertisments, exceptions were made for this as well. Meanwhile this mechanism has been undone, and we are assured by the team that this error in judgement will not happen again. There is an important lesson. We consider the type of functionality that NoScript provides quintessential to modern web users, as it is currently the state-of-the-art in protection against the risks that many 'web 2.0' technologies invoke --with both usability and security in mind. We think that Mozilla, Webkit, Microsoft and other browser suppliers should implement this natively --Opera has already taken the first steps-- thus taking the implementation of this type of important protection mechanism into their regular quality control system. We believe anything less is ultimately detrimental not only to the privacy of the user, but to the trust of the user in web tools such as browsers.","title":"Opinion about NoScript plugin affairs","url":"/news/2009/20090506-noscript.html"},

Or do you have an existing project that requires additional means to enable further development? Then submit your proposal to NLnet foundation before the next following deadline and see if we can help you. We are independent and put our money where our mouth is: that is to increase the use of open technologies for society. What is important for us is that the technology you develop or help promote is usable for others and has real impact. We are looking forward to your proposals! Note that we are also interested to hear your inspiring ideas if you are unable to manage them yourself. Plenty of possibilities NLnet Foundation (in Dutch: Stichting NLnet) is a philanthropic (private) not-for-profit organisation that invests its own trust funds to bring the open information society closer. Annually, the foundation spends around two million Euro in supporting strategic initiatives that contribute to an open information society, especially where these are aimed at development and dissemination of open standards and (network related) open source technology. Additionally the foundation wants to contribute to the societal debate on these subjects. NLnet foundation supports a large array of activities, from software development, standardisation work and development of educational material up to hacker festivals, digital rights activities and the international development of open source software licences.

How does it work A number of times a year, NLnet offers the opportunity to submit a proposal for support. Deadlines for submissions are announced on the webste. Projects need to be submitted before 12:00 o'clock CET (Central European Time). A project can also be an event or other matter, including travel grants and one-time events such as hackathons, lectures and conferences. In a short and clear procedure the foundation decides, based on relevance, quality and urgency which initiatives it supports and which it does not. A focus on societal impact and actual usage are considered as positive traits of a proposal. There is one important condition which is that any software or hardware that a project produces must be available under a valid open source licence (GPL, BSD, Apache, etc.). We appreciate it if (where relevant) your application contains a target audience for your project, and tells us how you are going to disseminate results and promote awareness. Within two weeks after the deadline you will hear if your project falls within the criteria, and within four weeks you will know if we want to take the project under our wings.

A project can also be an event or other matter, including travel grants and one-time events such as hackathons, lectures and conferences. In a short and clear procedure the foundation decides, based on relevance, quality and urgency which initiatives it supports and which it does not. A focus on societal impact and actual usage are considered as positive traits of a proposal. There is one important condition which is that any software or hardware that a project produces must be available under a valid open source licence (GPL, BSD, Apache, etc.). We appreciate it if (where relevant) your application contains a target audience for your project, and tells us how you are going to disseminate results and promote awareness. Within two weeks after the deadline you will hear if your project falls within the criteria, and within four weeks you will know if we want to take the project under our wings. After we have shared our vision on the project with you the project plan is finalised. We have quite an extensive network and many partners, and potentially we can hook you up with other experienced partners. If everything is in place, your project can be up and running within six weeks!! My idea needs more Projects that require a considerable additional amount of money than is possible through the open call of NLnet are advised to make an appointment with one of our staff to explain your idea and discuss the possibilities.

{"description":"OASE resultaten Op 8 maart 2006 worden de resultaten van het OASE programma gepresenteerd in Utrecht. OASE doelt voor Open Source stimlering voor het MKB marktsegment via MKB branch verenigingen\". NLnet neemt deel aan de OASE adviescommisie. Bijeenkomst over gebruik open source software in Nederland: 8 maart 2006, MediaPlaza (Jaarbeurs) te Utrecht. Sleutels voor innovatie Gedurende het programma Open Aanbod Software Expertise (OASE) dat Syntens in opdracht van het Ministerie van Economische Zaken drie jaar heeft uitgevoerd, kregen voorzitters en secretarissen van brancheverenigingen de sleutel aangereikt om de deur naar open source software te openen. Samen met de bij de verenigingen aangesloten leden werd open source software ontdekt en ge\\xEFmplementeerd. Nu, op 8 maart 2006 bij MediaPlaza in Utrecht, maken Syntens en het Ministerie van Economische Zaken de balans op. Op woensdag 8 maart van 15.00 tot 19.00 uur vindt de `slot'-bijeenkomst plaats. Het programma biedt deelnemers inzicht in de resultaten die zijn behaald. Ook horen zij hoe het staat met open source software in Nederland en hoe de toekomst er uitziet. Er wordt tevens stilgestaan bij de vorming van communities. DVD De resultaten van het programma zijn verwerkt in een DVD die aan het einde van deze bijeenkomst aan plaatsvervangend directeur-generaal van het Ministerie van Economische Zaken, de heer De Groene, wordt overhandigd. Ook alle deelnemers ontvangen deze DVD waarop een aantal deelnemende branches, ICT-bedrijven en MKB-ondernemers de ervaringen delen. Sleutel in handen Vakcentrum Levensmiddelen, Nederlandse Boekverkopersbond, Het Centrop, MoGroep, MarktOnderzoekAssociatie, KNGF, Nederlands Rundvee Syndicaat, ABU en Vereniging voor Rundveepedicure namen deel aan OASE en implementeerden open source software. Met open source software heeft de gebruiker de sleutel tot de software in handen. Die software kan vervolgens naar eigen wens en inzicht worden aangepast, gekopieerd en gedistribueerd. Verreweg de meeste software wordt aangeboden als 'closed source software'. De broncode blijft achter slot en grendel. Programma Na de presentatie van de resultaten door Syntens-projectleider Carlos Silva dos Santos, vertelt Wim van Slooten, directeur van de MarktOnderzoekAssociatie (MOA), over de betekenis van open source software voor deze branche- en beroepsvereniging. Het nieuwe kenniscentrum van MOA draait op deze software. Ook de Gezondheidsdienst voor Dieren (GD) maakt er gebruik van en dankzij deze software kunnen nu snel en eenvoudig runderen worden getraceerd. Dit komt de voedselveiligheid ten goede! Woordvoerder Frans Jansen legt de aanwezigen uit wat o.a. Cow Track betekent voor deze organisatie. Erwin Snijders van het ICT-bedrijf ROES geeft aan hoe er is samengewerkt met een aantal brancheorganisaties en wat zijn rol is geweest. Tot slot van het eerste gedeelte wordt door Dirk-Willem van Gulik en Jo Lahaye stilgestaan bij het belang van communities en de vorming ervan. Na de pauze vindt een onderhoudende discussie met de zaal plaats en prikkelt dagvoorzitter, Roy Tomeij, de aanwezigen met een aantal stellingen.

{"description":"NSD version 3.0 released [Press release by NLnet Labs] NLnet Labs is proud to announce the release of its Name Server Daemon, NSD3.0. NSD is an authoritative RFC compliant DNS nameserver. NSD was first conceived to allow for more genetic diversity for DNS server implementations used by the root-server system and it has been developed for operations in environments where speed, reliability, stability, and security are of high importance. NSD is currently used on root servers such as k.root-servers.net and is also in use by several top-level domains registries. NSD3 is the successor of NSD2 which has been extended to include support for incremental zone updates (IXFR), incoming and outgoing NOTIFY messages, and for DNAME. NSD3 can run as a secondary DNS server with RFC compliant timing, with no user-configured cron jobs needed, as was the case for NSD2. Besides, NSD3 has been made more stable by the redesign of its internal messaging system. NSD3 can now be configured with a configuration file. NSD3 is still authoritative only, open source and strives to be compliant with the relevant RFCs. More detailed information can be found on the NSD website. Release notes. NLnet Labs is committed to support NSD and its other software products on a best effort basis, free of charge. This form of community support is offered through a mailing lists and the bugzilla web interface. If for any reason NLnet Labs would stop community support of NSD such would be announced on our web pages at least two years in advance. We recognize that in some corporate environments this commitment to community support is not sufficient and that support needs to be codified. We therefore offer paid support contracts. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.","url":"/project/nlnetlabs/20060906-nsd3.0.html","title":"NSD version 3.0 released"},
{"description":"NLnet appoints Review Committee IHF Independent experts provide external eligibility check In december of 2016 the Internet Hardening Fund received a subsidy from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, in recognition of a prior motion in the Netherlands parliament by representative Kees Verhoeven. The Internet Hardening Fund is a private fund managed by NLnet foundation which operates independently of any other organisation. To be able to comply with the formal requirements of the subsidy mentioned above, NLnet has installed a indepedent Review Committee (\"Toetsingscommissie\") consisting of three experts from the internet and open source field, academia and the public sector. The committee is appointed for a period of one year. The committee receives no remuneration for its work, and its members have no other economic interests with the Internet Hardening Fund and/or links to NLnet Foundation as the organisation behind the fund. The Review Commitee receives the outcome of the selection process for the Internet Hardening Fund, with each member independently validating that all the projects that are selected are indeed eligible for the Internet Hardening Fund. They check whether the activities fit within the scope of the fund, that budgets are frugal, and that there are no other obvious operational, ethical or other concerns. The outcome of the review is sent to the Board of NLnet foundation, which has the final responsibility. If a worthwhile project turns out not to be eligible for some technical reason, NLnet is free to fund such a project from its own private budget or from another (thematic) fund with a similar scope. This transparent procedure provides an additional guarantee that any public means allocated to the Internet Hardening Fund can only be spent within the scope and spirit of the fund. The three appointed members of the commitee for 2017 are (in alphabetical order): Leon Kuunders, Niels Sijm and Bert Wijnen. Background information The main focus of the Internet Hardening Fund is twofold: on the one hand supporting high end open source encryption software used in the infrastructural layer, and on the other hand development and strengthening of the underlying internet and web standards in the area of encryption. The fund operates internationally. A new competitive call for proposals is launched every two months. Projects or individuals that request a grant will also automatically enter the competitive open call from NLnet, which additionally increases their chance of funding. Through the fund independent researchers and developers can requests grants in support of their efforts to improve and expand encryption and other means of securing internet communication.","title":"NLnet appoints Review Committee IHF","url":"/news/2017/20170203-ReviewCommittee-en.html"},
{"description":"Nederlandse internetpioniers krijgen internationale erkenning Geneve, 26 juni 2013 Twee Nederlanders, Teus Hagen en Kees Neggers zullen tijdens een internationale ceremonie in Berlijn in augustus worden opgenomen in de zogenaamde Internet Hall of Fame. Beiden speelden een voortrekkersrol in de totstandkoming van het internet in Europa, met een impact ver daarbuiten. Hagen nam in 1982 het initiatief voor de oprichting van EUnet, en nam vanuit het toenmalige Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam de leiding bij de opbouw van dit pan-Europese computernetwerk dat al snel transatlantische verbindingen aanging en daarna overging naar het in Amerika opkomende internetprotocol. In 1986 werd hij voorzitter van stichting NLnet en werd de eerste commerciele 'Internet Service Provisie' in ons land een feit. De commerciele activiteiten van NLnet werden in 1997 verkocht en met de opbrengst ging stichting NLnet met Hagen als algemeen directeur verder als een gerespecteerde charitatieve instelling die wereldwijd de ontwikkeling van het open internet stimuleert. Kees Neggers stond aan de basis van een aantal belangrijke internationale organisaties in de internetwereld, waaronder RARE, Internet Society, RIPE NCC, Ebone, CCIRN, de Amsterdam Internet Exchange en GLIF. Neggers vormde samen met Boudewijn Nederkoorn vanaf 1988 de directie van het Nederlandse SURFnet. Onder hun leiding dwong SURFnet wereldwijd erkenning af voor haar internationale voorlopersrol en het onderzoeks- en onderwijsnetwerk groeide in die periode uit tot een van de meest geavanceerde en gerespecteerde ter wereld. Neggers werd een jaar geleden voor zijn verdiensten al onderscheiden als Officier in de Orde van Oranje-Nassau. Met Hagen en Neggers komt het totaal Nederlandse internetpionieers in de Internet Hall of Fame op drie. Vorig jaar werd in Geneve de in Duitsland geboren Nederlander Daniel Karrenberg al opgenomen, als jongste van slechts vijf Europeanen. De Internet Hall of Fame is een initiatief van Internet Society, een vereniging voor internetprofessionals met wereldwijd meer dan 65.000 leden.

{"description":"Mail::Box phase 2, third progress report October 1, 2003, Mark Overmeer. Report on the progress of the Mail::Box phase 2 project in the previous 10 weeks. Tasks The following tasks where described in the project plan. For each task, the current status is described. User support This still consumes a lot of time, especially while debugging border situations with complex e-mail messages. The activity on the mailinglist (listed below) tells the story: often an intensive interaction between the developer and the problem reporter. Replacing old modules In the past two months, there has been made a major step towards connection with older modules. When one line in an existing script, (before running with an often used old e-mail library) is changed, the whole old program runs with the new software. The code is in alpha release, and needs testing. In an effort to produce more examples/replacements for existing code, a new module was created to demonstrate a procmail-like application written with Mail::Box. This module is waiting for name-space registration, and will probably be called Mail::Box::Procmail. Documentation The documentation is still growing in size, but the main improvements where made in a previous period. IMAP4 support No progress has been made in this area. Outlook support Reading Outlook DBX files was implemented in a previous period, and works without complaints. Database folders The idea on what this documentation should become has shaped, but the text has not been written yet. Unicode support Most parts are ready, but some better integration with other parts of the library is required to make it into a success. Mailinglist construction Completed in the previous period. Other authors have already extended it with patches, so there apparently was a need for this feature. Browser support A new module (named HTML::FromMail) implements a template system which connects to Mail::Box. Via templates, even the most complex web-mail clients can be built. The development of the module took more time than the three scheduled days, mainly caused by extended debates with the author of the template module on how his system should be extended to fulfil my needs. The module is waiting for name-space registration, and the next release of the template system's software.

{"description":"Mail::Box phase 2 project plan Mark A.C.J. Overmeer, solutions@overmeer.net. During the first phase of the NLnet Foundation's support for the Mail::Box module --an e-mail handling library for the Perl programming language-- the module improved considerably. This first phase covered 65 days, and ran from May 2002 until January 2003 This project plan describes a follow-up to Mail::Box phase&nbsp;1 with a second phase, to improve the quality of the module even further. This project plan describes the actions as agreed upon for this second (and last) phase of the Mail::Box sponsoring. Tasks NLnet Foundation agrees to sponsor Mark Overmeer --the developer of Mail::Box-- to achieve the goals mentioned in this chapter. During the project, the progress is evaluated every two months which may lead to change of plans. User support [9 days] E-mail support for users of the module consumes between one and two hours per day. A part of this effort is sponsored by NLnet during phase 2 of the project, and the rest is seen as voluntary contribution by the developer. Replacing old modules [3 days] The best way to get people to convert their existing applications to a new module (in this case Mail::Box) is to make this task as easy as possible for them. They must see a clear benefit of this conversion, and by chance convert without much effort. Both approaches will be taken: there will be a document which describes the differences with some existing modules as conversion guideline, and there will be some extra code to mimic the behavior of the other modules to reduce the conversion effort. Documentation [2 days] The existing examples from man-pages, FAQ, contributed scripts, and mailing list will be reorganized to create a kind of code base. It will help people understand the basics of the module faster than is achieved by reading manual pages. The allocated time is used to create a structure to contain these examples. IMAP4 support [10 days] Phase One of the project had a target to get someone implement IMAP4 folder support. This plan failed mainly because the IMAP4 protocol is large and complicated. IMAP4 support is not easy to realize as a voluntary activity, because it looks too much like real work. Therefore, in phase&nbsp;2 the developer of Mail::Box will implement the extension himself. Hopefully other people will contribute simpler folder extensions meanwhile. Outlook support [2 days] Since recently, an Open Source library can be used to read Outlook DBX files even on UNIX. The Perl wrapper around this library will be used to support read-only access. This extension will simplify the move from Windows to Unix/Linux because the personal mail-archives can be converted easily with Mail::Box. Database folders [2 days] Quite a few people want to use Mail::Box to parse messages, and then store the contained information in a database. An implementation to simplify this process is probably not useful, because everyone has a different organization within the database. The commonality between the implementations will be too small to justify a module. Therefore, the documentation will be extended to demonstrate and discuss alternatives. Unicode support [5 days] Use of Unicode within e-mail gains popularity very fast, especially now the Internet is flooded with new users from non-Western nations. Unicode support is not that easy, because all non-ASCII characters must be encoded into ASCII strings. Although full support for Unicode will take considerable more time than five days, the NLnet Foundation sees only limited use for their target community. The support will therefore be primarily used to facilitate the needs for spam filters based on Mail::Box. Mailing list construction [3 days] On the moment, support for handling of fields for mailing lists is lacking: people who need it have to implement it themselves. An implementation of the related RFCs will be added to the module. Browser support [3 days] Mail::Box already contains some pieces which","title":"Mail::Box phase 2 project plan","url":"/project/mailbox/200304-projectplan2.html"},
{"description":"Mail::Box 2, First Progress Report 14 May 2003, Mark Overmeer, MARKOV Solutions In the previous months In the first three months of the second phase of the Mail::Box project, most effort was put in promotional activities and user support. To describe the development since the end of Mail::Box phase 1: 1. Participation in the German Perl Workshop Four talks were presented, of which two were Mail::Box related: a) User::Identity and Mail::Identity (45 minutes talk, slides ) This subject is more e-mail related than the names of these new modules sound. These classes will help implement unicode use for e-mail by providing simple ways of configuration. User definitions on a system reaches much further than username and password: languages, character set, pgp keys etc. call for a structural approach, which this module hopes to provide. b) MIME Headers (15 minutes talk, slides ) E-mail MIME headers are terribly complicated when implemented in the full extend of the RFCs. Demonstrated is how Mail::Box hides all complications for common use. The slides of both talks are published on the conference CD and on a website. Besides, I organized E-mail BoF session In a group of 14 we discussed our e-mail related work, ideas, problems, and needs. The participants received the minutes of meeting to keep in touch in the future. 2. Preparations to YAPC North America It took considerable effort to get an invitation to speak on the YAPC::NA conference, which will taken place in June. Efforts to get a talk on OSCON2003 were in vain. About 90 is available for me to fill with one or two talks. Probably 45 minutes on pure Mail::Box, and the other half on a related subject (probably OODoc). I will produce a new Mail::Box talk especially for this conference. 3. Mail::Box documentation In the last year, the documentation of Mail::Box was improved in many ways. Next to the traditional POD manual pages, it also became capable of producing manual pages in HTML using all the benefits of HTML. This production of manual pages grew into a large script, which attracted other people's attention. In the recent months, the way Mail::Box creates documentation was reimplemented into a separate module named OODoc. It became a documentation system which can handle raw documents from various sources, and generate manual pages in different formats. The OODoc has already attracted quite some attention. I gave a talk about the ideas on the German Perl Workshop, a demonstration on how to use it at the monthly Dutch Perl Mongers meeting, and O'Reilly asked for an article about this subject for their Perl website Perl.com. The re-implementation of the documentation tool gave the opportunity to enforce more strict checking to fight documentation inconsistencies. Mail::Box has been converted to use the new system ( location ). OODoc also provides better ways to navigate between the available examples and tutorials. The structure is better to understand for (new) users. 4. Releases The Mail::Box module had a new release about every three weeks. The previous period showed mainly bug-fix releases. Many different people contributed reports or even patches. version 2.042: will be released this week version 2.041: Thu May 8 14:05:32 CEST 2003 version 2.040: Mon Apr 14 15:48:54 CEST 2003 version 2.039: Sun Mar 30 17:34:43 CEST 2003 version 2.038: Wed Feb 26 16:20:03 CET 2003 version 2.037: Sun Feb 23 14:53:50 CET 2003 version 2.036: Thu Feb 13 18:18:29 CET 2003 5.

Version 1.2.4-en, February 16 2006. Dear sir, madam, We write to you regarding several errors we found in the content of your site www.anti-piracy.nl and in your brochure Piracy in the workplace. At page 11 of your brochure (\"What is allowed, and what is not\") you write \"It is not allowed to create a copy of a computer game or other software; not even for your own private use\". A similar broad statement can be read on your web site in the F.A.Q. section \"Am I allowed to make copues of my computer games and other software\". These statements are incorrect, or at least too broad. A large number of software programs are distributed by their copyright owners under a license that grants users the right to make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the softwares. An important group of copyright owners that do this are the authors of so-called open source software. The signers of this letter are all developers of open source software or organisations (companies, non-profit foundations) who have a (financial) interest in this kind of software. In your brochure and on your web site you suggest that there exists a categorical prohibition against copying of software. With this statement you obstruct the legimitate goals of these copyright owners and their organisations to develop software and distribute it as free software. Signers are against the illegal copying of software. We therefore stress the distrinction between software that may be copied freely, and software that, due to a licensing restrictions, may not be copied. It is of the highest importance that users and customers are correctly informed about this important distinction. We therefore request that you update your brochure and web site to the effect that the relevant paragraphs reflect the existing distinction between free (open source) and non-free software. We can always assist you in finding a correct and public-friendly description of this complicated subject matter.","url":"/news/2006/20060221-brein-en.html","title":"Letter to Brein"},
{"description":"LCC; description [Local Content Caching: An Investigation -- concluded on 2002/11] Introduction Centralized search engines, allowing searching of a fraction of the entire internet, are encountering significant scalability problems as servers struggle to keep up with the exponential growth of content providers and the amount of content provided. The main problem for a search engine, or any other content \"user\" for that matter, is keeping an up-to-date (processed) copy of the content of each content provider. Because there is no \"protocol\" for content providers to let search-engines know that there is new content, or that old content has been deleted or updated, search engines periodically \"visit\" the content provider, often fetching content that was fetched before. Valuable resources are used in this process, while the results are still inherently out of date. Another problem is that content providers on the Internet provide content in a form that is good for the human reader, but which is not really ideal for the type of processing needed to create a search engine or similar process. This six month pilot-project will investigate what would be needed to create a system of local content caching, in which a content provider can notify a Local Content Cache of new (or updated or deleted) content. This content will then be collected by that Local Content Cache, possibly in a form more suitable for content processing than the form in which it is presented to the human reader. Such a Local Content Cache can then be used by a search engine, or any other content \"user\" such as an intelligent agent, for its own purposes. A proof of concept implementation of the software needed for a Content Provider, a Local Content Cache and Content Users such as search engines and intelligent agents, will be part of this pilot-project. Architectural Overview The goal of this pilot-project is to create a functioning proof-of-concept in which: one or more Content Providers can notify a Local Content Cache of new, updated or deleted content. a Local Content Cache can then fetch the indicated content from the Content Provider in the manner and at the time indicated by the Content Provider. the fetched data can provide different \"views\" of the same underlying data (i.e., the data can be provided in several different forms) the content fetched by the Local Content Cache is stored on the server on which the Local Content Cache software modules are running. a Content User is able to interrogate the Local Content Cache for a list of new, updated or deleted content. a Content User is able to obtain this content from the Local Content Cache. a Content User can be shown to work on the content as provided by the Local Content Cache.","url":"/project/lcc/description.html","title":"LCC; Description"},
{"description":"Ksplice wins MIT $100k business plan contest Uninterrupted updates offer vast improvement of security Today, every mainstream operating system requires regular reboots in order to be up to date and secure. Since reboots cause downtime and disruption, people are forced into the uncomfortable dilemma of choosing between security, cost and convenience. The NLnet funded open source project KSplice offers a unique working solution to allow computers to safely operate with far less disruption. KSplice promises to reduce downtime by a order of magnitude -by updating the core operating systems kernel text while it is still running. This revolutionary technology significantly hinders network attackers by reducing the window of vulnerability during which computer systems are running software with known problems. NLnet congratulates the team at KSplice Inc for winning the 20th anniversary of the annual MIT $100k Entrepreneurship Competition, leaving over 260 competing projects behind. NLnet has been sponsoring the project since late 2008, just four months after the inception of the company. \"We believe KSplice has a lot of potential for making the internet a safer place\", says Michiel Leenaars, director of Strategy at NLnet. \"It is a great example of how open source enables new generations to improve significantly on technology which seems ubiquitous. The story of KSplice really reads like a movie plot: five clever students beat all the corporate developers to the punch and by and large solve a long standing issue in IT. It makes a great business case for stimulating students to work with open source, so they are allowed to innovate instead of allowed to just click within someone elses applications\". The KSplice project was started over three years ago when lead developer Jeff Arnold was working on MIT's servers and had to deal with a security update that arrived midweek. He decided to delay installing it until the weekend to avoid downtime while the servers were in heavy use. Unfortunately, the delay resulted in a security breach that required reinstalling all the system software. Arnold wrote an award-winning master's degree thesis about the subject matter, and this ultimately led to the development of a working solution. Technically, Ksplice creates rebootless updates that are based on traditional source code patches. These updates are as effective as traditional updates, but they can be applied seamlessly, with no downtime. While the Ksplice updating system is currently only available for computers running Linux, the code is written in a way that should make it very easy to transfer to Mac and Windows operating systems as well as to user space applications.","title":"Ksplice wins MIT $100k business plan contest","url":"/project/ksplice/20090602-wins.html"},

{"description":"ISC BIND 9; description [Development of BIND 9 -- concluded on 2001/05] The Internet Software Consortium ( ISC ) is a non-profit organization with the aim to produce reference software implementations of essential Internet standards. These implementations are generally of high quality: examples in the area of network production are well known. One of the best known projects of ISC is BIND (\"Berkeley Internet Name Daemon\"), an implementation of the Internet Domain Name Service protocol. BIND is the standard implementation, is a crucial building block for all Internet traffic, and is widely used. In 1998, ISC drew up an implementation plan for BIND&nbsp;9. In addition to a number of extensions and architectural changes to its predecessor, BIND&nbsp;8, this plan aims to solve scaling problems due to, for instance, database handling completely in memory. BIND&nbsp;9 will also provide a solid implementation of Secure DNS; the authentication and verification of database records and name servers. ISC found a number of computer vendors willing to finance this development. However, the project's implementation was threatened by significant delays due to the low speed with which contracts and funding could be effectuated. Also, the fear that licensing restrictions may be placed on the new implementation, limiting its widespread availability, was a reason to fund this project. The NLnet Foundation provided an initial subsidy of US$&nbsp;85,000 to ISC, which permitted the start of the BIND&nbsp;9 work in August 1998, and also ensured its widespread, availability. At the same time, this has sped up the implementation of a number of DNSSEC security features. In the meantime, the financial support promised by the computer vendors has become available. According to the original plan, the first scalable version of BIND&nbsp;9 should have been available in May 1999, and the complete production version, including all security features, in October 1999. However, the development effort has been seriously underestimated. According to the revised project plan, a complete release of BIND&nbsp;9 will be available around May/June 2000. In July 1999, Stichting NLnet has provided ISC with a guarantee of US$&nbsp;500,000 to cover additional development costs which possibly couldn't be recovered from other subsidies or development income, under the condition that the BIND&nbsp;9 code was published under BSD licensing conditions. The NLnet Labs, another project initiated by Stichting NLnet, has worked on the evaluation and deployment of secure DNS systems based on the BIND&nbsp;9 implementation.","url":"/project/iscbind9/description.html","title":"ISC BIND 9; Description"},

For that occasion, Richard Stallman gave the key speech at an event party in Boston. This presentation was streamed over internet. The Novell and Microsoft patent deal had caused some delay in the process, originally due for March 2007. The activities by Microsoft were used to demonstrate the need for GPLv3; the media attention for the deal was used to tell the story of the free software movement. Free Software got promoted with articles and videos, and through on-line and local community activities. The drafts of GPLv3 met considerable opposition from corporations. These reactions were encouraged by the large media conglomorates which utilize Digital Rights Management (DRM), making digital copying and sharing impossible. In tactical response, an antiDRM campaign was launched on May 23rd 2006 to raise public awareness. It successfully aimed to name DRM as an antisocial technology. Over 25,000 technologists joined the campaign, pledging to take direct action to the threats posed by DRM. This `DefectiveByDesign' campaign had significant press coverage. It shows that technologists can be social activists. This campaign is still ongoing. A series of short video clips are being developed on video sharing sites. They focus on the popular story of the Free Software Movement. In a number of Open Letters to be created, well-known personalities will promote Free Software.

Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project and Free Software Foundation, the GNU General Public License (\"the GPL\") is the Constitution and central license of the Free Software movement, securing users' rights to freely study, copy, modify, reuse, share and redistribute software. The GPL builds upon the ethical and scientific principle of free, open and collaborative improvement of human knowledge, which was central to the rapid evolution of areas like mathematics, physics, or biology, and adapts it to the area of information technology. By now, the GPL is employed by tens of thousands of software projects, companies and governments around the world, and is supported by large communities of software developers and users who wish to share their work for the benefit of all. The GNU system, the Linux kernel, Samba, MySQL, and many thousands of other GPL'd programs, offer high technological quality as well as political and economic independence and sustainability. GPL'd software runs on or is embedded in devices ranging from cellphones, PDAs and home networking appliances to mainframes and supercomputing clusters. Independent software developers around the world, as well as every large corporate IT buyer and seller, and a surprisingly large proportion of individual users, interact with the GPL. The current version of the license, which was written in 1991 and is now 14 years old, has become central to the activities and operation of a large part of all companies and governments and is now in need of review. The development of version 3 of this licence will bring together thousands of organizations, software developers, and software users from around the globe during 2006, in an effort to update the worlds most popular Free Software license. The GPLv3 promises to be one of the largest participatory comments and adoption efforts ever undertaken.

{"description":"FSF; description [Free Software Foundation -- concluded on 2008] In the past fifteen years, GNU software has proven to be of fundamental importance for many Open Source software projects. Many projects would never have been imagined or started without the availability of GNU software tools. Also, the example set by the GNU licensing model GPL is eminently important for the development of publicly available software technology. The Free Software Foundation, guardian of the GNU project, has played and continues to play a very important role, even though the GNU system may appear complete (but isn't really). New projects are still being started (e.g. GNOME ), and new versions of previously developed software are being distributed. Due to its principally non-commercial base, the Free Software Foundation can only exist thanks to donations and volunteer work. A financial contribution is therefore a good way to support the work of the FSF. There is a tendency to take the work of the FSF for granted, but this is detracting from the efforts which are necessary to keep this prolific software source flowing. The relationship between the activities of the Free Software Foundation, such as the GNU project, and the goals of Stichting NLnet is indirect. NLnet is generally focussing on the stimulation of the development of specific network (internet) technology etc. In the case of GNU and FSF, network technology is not always directly involved. However, the core technology of GNU, as embodied by gcc, gdb and the GNU software development tools for example, is of crucial importance for the development of publicly available network (internet) technology and deserves the support by NLnet because of its exceptional position.","url":"/project/fsf/description.html","title":"FSF; Description"},
{"description":"Final report cp2pc By Maarten van Steen, Ihor Kuz Background The cp2pc project was initiated in 2002 aiming to construct a client-side \"gateway\" that would allow different file-sharing peer-to-peer networks to interoperate. Such a client-side gateway is often also referred to as an &Uuml;berClient. The project was funded by the NLnet Foundation. The technical results of the project are summarized in an accompanying paper that will be submitted for publication in the Linux Journal. In this note, we make a brief assessment of the project. This assessment is motivated by the series of SIRS projects that have also been funded by NLnet. However, unlike SIRS, we made a serious attempt to improve the dissemination of the results of cp2pc. The cp2pc Approach The cp2pc project was split into two separate phases. During the first phase, we primarily concentrated on the feasibility of developing an integrating client, and spent time on studying existing P2P networks. The goal of this phase was to develop an initial architecture/design of an integrating client that was based on a commonly acceptable API. Designing the API was done after studying five different systems: Gnutella, JXTA, Mnet, CFS (a file system based on the Chord peer-to-peer system), and GDN (which has been developed as part of the SIRS projects). The outcome of this work was an API that turned out to be very stable. Also, we achieved a good impression concerning the necessary components for the integrating client. Furthermore, not only did we have a founded choice for the P2P networks that were to be supported (namely Gnutella and GDN), but we also were able to write a reasonably detailed, yet flexible plan of work that gave confidence that actual results could be accomplished in a the following phase. The choice for Gnutella and GDN was partly based on the observation that these are internally two very different systems. Furthermore, Gnutella was chosen for its popularity. Our intimate knowledge of GDN was a main reason for choosing that system. Furthermore, it turned out that Chord had a number of serious portability problems. The second phase, which started roughly four months after the start of the first phase, concentrated on actual development work. We used Java as our implementation language. As usual in most software projects, there were delays and set backs, but by-and-large, we eventually managed to deliver the promised results. The duration of the project was longer than expected, but the delay can be attributed almost fully to the fact that we simply put less effort per time unit into actual cp2pc efforts than originally planned. However, the quality of the actual client (i.e., its user interface) is not as nice as we initially aimed for. Also, much more time was spent on other parts of cp2pc than client development so that the client became available only late in the project. Dissemination Besides these two phases, we immediately set up a mailing list and actively participated in discussions with groups working on similar problems, notably Tristero. In the end, we managed to divide some of the work between Tristero and cp2pc by which results from either project were exchanged and incorporated. Earlier in 2002, we had a poster session at the SANE conference in Maastricht. One of the important issues here was that we were forced to present ourselves in an early phase of the project, an activity which helped to keep us focussed on one of the goals of cp2pc, namely that eventually others would take over development. Furthermore, to better disseminate results, Ihor Kuz attended the CodeCon conference to have face-to-face discussions with a number of Tristero members (a trip report is added to this note). Conclusions One of the most important results from this approach has been the wider and immediate dissemination of the outcomes of cp2pc. We have been approached by several groups claiming they did something similar, and have exchanged code with a number of them.","title":"Final report cp2pc","url":"/project/cp2pc/20030425-final.html"},

{"description":"Een nieuwe toekomst voor de Stichting NLnet NLUUG en NLnet nieuwsbrief Jaargang 6, nummer 1, februari 1998 Teus Hagen, Frances Brazier, Wytze van der Raay en Jos Alsters Bestuur Stichting NLnet. De geschiedenis Al weer bijna 10 jaar geleden, in 1988, richtte de vereniging NLUUG de Stichting NLnet op om de netwerk exploitatie in onder te brengen. De vereniging NLUUG mocht niet in gevaar gebracht worden door de steeds grotere financi&euml;le risico's die de exploitatie met zich meebracht. De Stichting NLnet richtte op haar beurt in 1994 de Holding NLnet B.V. op die vervolgens het toenmalige internet netwerk in Nederland op professionele verder uitbouwde tot de huidige infrastructuur, waarbij kwaliteitstoegang wordt geboden aan kleine en grote, professionele en niet-professionele gebruikers. De NLnet Holding B.V., die startte met een drietal werknemers, groeide in korte tijd uit tot een toonaangevende nationale internet Provider met ruim 90 werknemers eind 1997. Het was echter wel al lang duidelijk dat verder doorgroeien steeds moeilijker vol te houden zou zijn. Met name het groeien in internationale transportcapaciteit betekent dat steeds grotere (financi&euml;le) sprongen genomen moeten worden, terwijl de tarieven door meer (en grotere) concurrenten omlaag zullen gaan. Om verdere groei van NLnet Holding B.V. zeker te kunnen stellen, was dan ook op termijn (internationale) samenwerking met een zowel financieel als technisch sterke partner wenselijk. Na ruim een jaar zoeken en ori&euml;nteren werd in 1997 UUnet (dochter van WorldCom), een zowel financieel en technisch sterke partner gevonden. Afgelopen zomer werd middels een aandelenruil dit samengaan ge&euml;ffectueerd. Dit leidde tot grote veranderingen voor de Stichting NLnet. Zij had gedurende de periode tot het samengaan met UUnet alleen op de achtergrond invloed als als hoofdaandeelhouder van NLnet Holding B.V. Na de aandelenruil werd de Stichting NLnet weliswaar eigenaar van een pakket WorldCom aandelen van grote financi&euml;le waarde, maar verloor haar invloed op de NLnet holding. De toekomst De Stichting NLnet ziet zich nu geconfronteerd met een nieuwe uitdaging: het besteden van de thans in ruimere mate beschikbare financi&euml;le middelen voor het opzetten van nieuwe activiteiten in lijn met haar doelstelling. Deze doelstelling, oorspronkelijk in 1988 breed geformuleerd als \"het bevorderen van elektronische informatie uitwisseling\", is in de loop van de jaren toegespitst op het medium internet. Met name op het publieke, niet-commerci&euml;le gebied zien wij hier nog grote mogelijkheden in het verschiet, welke in de komende jaren verder uitgewerkt kunnen worden, in volledige onafhankelijkheid van overheid en bedrijfsleven. Inmiddels is al een dialoog aangegaan met een aantal organisaties als de NLUUG, Usenix, ISOC en het Internet Software Consortium (zonder overigens uitbreiding van deze lijst uit te sluiten!) om deze mogelijkheden verder te concretiseren. Hierbij denken we op dit moment aan: Het ondersteunen van de ontwikkeling van \"public domain\" software ten dienste van het internet en internetgebruikers. Het in eigen beheer (uit)ontwikkelen van dergelijke software. Het organiseren en/of ondersteunen van conferenties op internet gebied. Het bevorderen van academisch onderzoek op netwerk gebied. Het gebruiksklaar maken van onderzoeksresultaten voor de internet-praktijk en het ondersteunen van activiteiten die leiden tot een betere toegankelijkheid van het internet, zowel op technisch als organisatorisch terrein. Deze lijst zal ongetwijfeld in de komende tijd uitgebreid en bijgesteld worden. De volgorde is toevallig en de lijst is ook zeker niet bedoeld als een uitputtende opsomming.

Secondly the \"near eof: ran out of space\" error message should be virtually eliminated. Performance testing is next on the list as all the major drivers are done now. As always please beat DLZ up, find out if anything is broken and let me know about it. Later, Rob Extract from the Changelog Added LDAP driver & DLZ LDAP schema. Read the LDAP docs for specifics of how to use this driver. Like all the other drivers the LDAP driver was built to be as flexible as possible, and use of the DLZ LDAP schema is not required. It is simply supplied to make use of the DLZ LDAP driver easier. Fixed the \"case bug\" for drivers which use the SDLZ driver filter. This affected all the drivers currently supplied with DLZ, but primarily caused a problem with the file system and Berkeley DB drivers. Now all host &amp; zone information will be converted to lower case before it is passed to any of the ASCII based drivers. Fixed the \"near eof: ran out of space\" bug for ASCII drivers. This message should almost never occur anymore. I modified the buffer initial_size algorithm to better estimate the needed buffer size in order to prevent the message. Even if the message does show up, DLZ will handle things properly internally by doubling the buffer size and trying again - as it always has. Updated configure to perform better searching for Berkeley DB's headers/ libraries when the path is supplied. This should make building DLZ with the Berkeley DB driver easier on FreeBSD and other BSD based distributions. Converted most of the docs to webpages. Originally all of DLZ's docs were text based. Once the new website went up the required all the docs to be maintained in two formats. This is more work, and may cause an inconsistency in the docs. For that reason all DLZ driver docs are now only available as HTML. In the future the remaining documentation will probably be converted to HTML and the text versions eliminated.","url":"/project/bind-dlz/20031102-release-060.html","title":"DLZ version 0.6.0 released"},

{"description":"Conclusions, August 2003 Goal of the research The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to explore the legal implications of agent technology, specifically focussing on implications for software development. The concrete aim of this project was to provide a 'cookbook' for (1) designers of agent systems on the way to design (and code) intelligent agents in a legally valid way and (2) legal experts, policy makers as well as other relevant parties indicating where new laws have to be formulated or clarification is needed with respect to existing law. This cookbook has now been published as a technical report: see http://www.iids.org/alias/ Process and Results This project required considerable interaction between legal experts, computer scientists and AI experts. To acquire a common understanding of the problem area and its breadth a number of scenarios were studied: the goal being to understand the issues involved. These scenarios include grocery shopping, chemical commodities marketplace, local government automation and hospital automation. Relevant legal and technical implications have been analysed, e.g., resulting in the realisation that a conceptual distinction between open and closed systems provides a basis for further analysis. Intermediary concepts were developed to overcome language and conceptual barriers between legal experts and computer scientists, forming the basis for a structured analysis of legal aspects of software agents. The areas explored included agent autonomy with e.g. respect to contract negotiation, eg Are agents legal entitites? Who's liable for possible damage? identifiability and traceability, eg Can an agent remain anonymous? Pseudo-anonymous? integrity and originality, eg: May sysadmins kill agents on their own machines? With which risk? trust, eg: What are the obligations of an agent with respect to confidentiality? Conclusion The results of this project show that this area is clearly very broad, the legal aspects are [numerous and are not yet fully clear, nor are they] fully understood, and that interaction between different disciplines is necessary will they ever be understood. This interaction will help legal experts to adapt present law so new technologies can be lawfully applied. It will also help software designers to comply with the legal requirements. Identity management is one of the areas in which further research is required: technological and legal aspects need to be considered in this process. The researcher groups involved in this project are continuing this research to acquire a better understanding of the options and their implications.","title":"Conclusions, August 2003","url":"/project/alias/20030815-final.html"},
{"description":"CodeYard; description [CodeYard, \"Scholier en Open Source\" -- concluded on 2008/09/01] Computer Science is a growing subject in high schools (12-to-18-year old students). In 2007 it will become a 'profielkeuzevak', a core profile course, for the Dutch high school curriculum. The CodeYard project aims to attract students to the production of Open Source Software (OSS). Students can use the infrastructure and expertise of the CodeYard project to produce OSS which can be passed on to future generations of students, leading to a wider use and more production of OSS. The CodeYard project aims to attract students to OSS by providing infrastructure with low barriers to entry and local expertise related to the technical issues the students may face. New software will be developed to support students working together using the SUbversion revision control system. Students should find out that writing OSS is fun. In this respect the community-building aspect of CodeYard is more important than the code that might be written there. We need to attract students to OSS so that they stick around in the long term, and do not just use it briefly to fulfil their high school credits requirements. In this sense the CodeYard project is an idealistic one, and depends on the enthusiasm and cooperation of local high school students. There are many projects that illustrate the use of OSS in educational or high school settings, and there are even entire Linux distributions (for instance SkoleLinux ) devoted to it. Stichting NLnet supports several such educational projects, like SchoolLan and ThinkQuest. Other projects, such as Ratio, are geared towards providing educational material on specific subjects (Mathematics, in Ratio's case). None of these projects engage the students at high schools in the design, implementation, and testing of the products being delivered. The Open Source philosophy behind them is just that --behind them. CodeYard aims to bring it to the forefront and actively engage students in the Open Source community.","title":"CodeYard; Description","url":"/project/codeyard/description.html"},
{"description":"CAcert at the HCC Dagen [Robert Kochheim, november 2004] As a follow up on the CAcert activities at the SANE 2004 conference, the HCC Unix user group created a CAcert booth at the HCC Dagen event. Like with all of these conferences we started with good hope and prepared well with 300 empty forms, and assurers from NLUUG, NLnet and HCC Unix manned the booth. That was wrong! In three days more than 1750 assurances were made and over 200 new Dutch assurers were added. To put this number in perspective the current list worldwide count only 800 assurers. Many HCC groups have adopted CAcert and will help to expand the web of trust by assuring users at their local meetings (these are open for public). In line with that, a website has been registered to give Dutch support and documentation ( http://www.cacert.nl ).","url":"/project/cacert/20041122-hcc.html","title":"CAcert at the HCC Dagen"},

A special corner in the exposition space was dedicated to do CAcert assurances and PGP signing, as NLUUG service to its member. Over one third of the attendees where in \"The Web Of Trust\" at the end of the day. The next day, on May 27, NLnet sponsored a special KDE-PIM hackathon in Achtmaal and made sure that the major part of KDE developers made it to Assurer as well. On the same day, NLnet CAcert assurers were present on a multi-media OSS event in the TOSti building in Tilburg. From now on, it is easy to get your CAcert validation done with a visit to the TOSti building. Developments CAcert is busy to collect information and OSS software guidelines for creating and accessing CAcert X.509 certificats on security devices as the GemPlus small sized smartcard and USB reader and the USB eToken of eAladdin. The top three countries for listed assurers are: Germany (309), USA (255) and Holland (224).

{"description":"Bolkestein winnaar van Big Brother Awards PERSBERICHT Bits of Freedom [Amsterdam, 24 oktober 2004; persbericht] EU Commissaris Bolkestein is een van de winnaars van de Big Brother Awards 2004 die zondagavond zijn uitgereikt tijdens een drukbezochte ceremonie in Paradiso, Amsterdam. Met de award worden personen, bedrijven en overheden te kijk gezet die zich het afgelopen jaar te buiten zijn gegaan aan het controleren van burgers en afbreken van hun privacy. Andere winnaars zijn het Centrum voor Werk en Inkomen, het Digidoor project in Almere en het Europees plan voor het bewaren van bel- en surfgedrag. De jaarlijkse uitreiking werd voor de derde maal georganiseerd door de burgerechtenorganisatie Bits of Freedom. EU Commissaris Bolkestein heeft de award in de categorie personen gekregen voor het sluiten van een overeenkomst met de VS waarin de EU zijn privacy-wetgeving opschort om zo de overdracht mogelijk te maken van passagiersgegevens aan de VS. Bolkestein heeft de overeenkomst in 2003 namens de Commissie gesloten. Het Europees parlement heeft hevig geprotesteerd en het Europees Hof van Justitie gevraagd de overeenkomst ongedaan te maken. In de categorie bedrijven en instellingen heeft Digidoor een award gekregen. Digidoor is een project van scholen in Almere waarbij gegevens van basisschool-leerlingen in een digitaal bestand worden verzameld. Het bestand bevat veel gevoelige informatie over leerlingen en is te benaderen vanaf het internet. Uit informatie van de projectleider van Digidoor blijkt dat bij de opzet nooit is nagedacht over privacy en beveiliging. Ook ontbreekt een reglement en hebben de ouders van de leerlingen geen informatie ontvangen. In de categorie overheden heeft het Centrum voor Werk en Inkomen een award gekregen. Het Centrum voor Werk en Inkomen is het afgelopen jaar een aantal malen in het nieuws geweest nadat bleek dat de instelling het met de privacy van werkzoekenden niet zo nauw neemt. Het Centrum bleek het internetgebruik van werkzoekenden heimelijk en op afstand volgen. In elk van de 130 CWI kantoren is een aparte kantoorruimte ingericht waar personeel alles kan zien wat werkzoekenden op de terminals doen. Bovendien bleek het Centrum de persoonlijke gegevens van werkzoekenden op internet te plaatsen. Complete CV's werden online gezet, inclusief naam, adres, e-mail adres en zelfs geheime telefoonnummers. De bewaarplicht verkeersgegevens heeft een award gekregen in de categorie voorstellen. Het Kabinet is voorstander van dit Europees plan om telefoon- en internetbedrijven voortaan alle gegevens over bel- en surfgedrag te laten opslaan. Van 450 miljoen Europeanen wordt dan systematisch bewaard naar wie zij hebben gebeld, ge-sms't en e-mail verstuurd, vanaf welke plekken ze mobiel gebeld hebben en welke websites zij hebben bezocht. Deze zeer ingrijpende maatregel geeft overheden toegang tot zeer persoonsgevoelige informatie van alle dus ook onverdachte burgers. Uit de in totaal 12 nominaties (verdeeld over vier categorie&euml;n) komt volgens de jury een duidelijke trend naar voren. De overheid legt zich meer en meer toe op het verzamelen en verwerken van grote hoeveelheden 'zachte' informatie over onverdachte burgers. De jury van de Big Brother Awards bestaat uit advocaat Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm, jurist Lodewijk Asscher, hoogleraar computerbeveiliging Bart Jacobs, jurist Bert-Jaap Koops, adviseur Fred Eisner en publiciste Karin Spaink. De winnaars werden bekend gemaakt tijdens een druk bezochte uitreiking in Paradiso, Amsterdam, gepresenteerd door columnist Pieter Hilhorst. Met de Big Brother Awards wil Bits of Freedom duidelijk maken dat privacy geen abstract begrip is dat uitsluitend betrekking heeft op anderen. Door de dieptepunten van het afgelopen jaar op een rij te zetten, wordt privacy herkenbaar en bespreekbaar.","url":"/project/bof/20041026-bigbrother.html","title":"Bolkestein winnaar van Big Brother Awards"},

{"description":"Awards The selected projects within the November 2013 Call are: Koruza KORUZA is an innovative open-source open-hardware wireless communication system, employing a new low-cost approach to designing free-space optical network systems, enabling building-to-building connectivity with a highly collimated light beam at a capacity of 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps) at distances up to 100 m. It is designed to be suitable for home as well as professional users, enabling organic bottom-up growth of networks by eliminating the need for wired fiber connections and associated high installation costs. The simplicity of use, low-cost and compact size allow the system to be deployed in any network. More about KORUZA SecureShare The SecureShare project implement of a social messaging service based the GNUnet peer-to-peer framework offering scalability, extensibility, and end-to-end encrypted communication. The scalability property is achieved through multicast message delivery, while extensibility is made possible by using PSYC (Protocol for SYnchronous Communication), which provides an extensible RPC (Remote Procedure Call) syntax that can evolve over time without having to upgrade the software on all nodes in the network. Another key feature provided by the PSYC layer are stateful multicast channels, which are used to store e.g. user profiles. End-to-end encrypted communication is provided by the mesh service of GNUnet, upon which the multicast channels are built. Pseudonymous users and social places in the system have cryptographical identities &emdash; identified by their public key &emdash; these are mapped to human memorable names using GNS (GNU Name System), where each pseudonym has a zone pointing to its places. More about SecureShare PSYC2 Protocol for SYnchronous Conferencing is an efficient text-based protocol for delivery of data to a flexible amount of recipients or people, by unicast or multicast. PSYC2 represents a next iteration of the PSYC framework in conjunction with SecureShare, another NLnet supported project that aims to build a novel social messaging system as part of the GNUnet peer-to-peer system. More about PSYC2 nftables nftables is the intended successor of the popular iptables, providing a new modular packet filtering framework e.g. for operating systems based on the popular Linux kernel. Besides a modular code base that is better suited for modern multiprotocol networking environments, the nftables project aims to introduce powerful new userspace tools which will allow users to dynamically perform packet filtering on custom protocols (including but not limited to new proposed internet standards as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force). Existing packet filtering solutions would require a recompiled kernel module in the same situation. The end result is that users will have more autonomy on what gets filtered and how, which make them less dependent on the technical choices of vendors and communities. The nftables project has been accepted in Linux mainstream kernel. More about nftables FTEproxy Network communications are increasingly becoming the target of surveillance and censorship. One natural defense is to use traditional cryptographic protocols &emdash; traditional encryption incurs low-overhead and does a good job of providing privacy. However, because encryption is so effective, many governments (e.g., Iran, Pakistan, and China) are willing to block state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols such as TLS and SSH. FTEproxy provides transport-layer protection to resist keyword filtering, censorship and discriminatory routing policies. Its job is to relay datastreams, such as web browsing traffic, by encoding streams as messages that match a user-specified regular expression.

{"description":"Awards Project Wormhole (NL) and Samizdat (USA) are the latest two recipients of a grant from the Real-Time Communication fund. The RTC fund is a crowdsourcing effort aimed at creating future proof solutions for the way people communicate with each other without a single point of control. The fund is managed by the Netherlands based internet charity NLnet foundation, that has been funding projects since 1997. The two projects were selected out of 26 open source projects submitted from around the world to an open call in October. \"Both projects are conceptually ground-breaking\", says Michiel Leenaars, director of strategy at NLnet foundation. \"Project Wormhole for enabling a convergence of mainstream real-time communication that just works and Samizdat for enabling somehow the exact opposite - a personal communication channel for people under difficult circumstances.\" Project Wormhole is a new technology approach to bridge the two major standards-based real-time communication technologies, while Samizdat provides a novel approach to individuals communicating privately in hostile environments such as under repressive regimes. Part of the funding from project Wormhole is provided from another fund - the DNSSEC fund - to enable the delivered software to be DNSSEC-aware. NLnet foundation organises an open call six times a year, and has contributed to key developments around internet standardisation, security, semantic technology, open document formats and privacy. The next deadline is February 1st 2012. Donations to the fund for enabling future projects are welcomed. About Project Wormhole - a Jingle XMPP/SIP SIMPLE gateway There are two leading internet technologies emerging as the future of real-time communication: SIP and XMPP. This project and its outcome will provide the possibility for users of both universes to use either protocol to interoperate with each other for audio, instant messaging and presence. If the software is installed on the desktop next to an existing application it can encapsulate or tunnel conversations from one protocol to the other - serving as a wormhole between the two universes. It should work transparently with little or no configuration. It will allow users to share contacts and establish chat and audio sessions without having to bother of the protocol used to address buddies in user@domain format. If the software is used on a server, one should simply point the appropriate DNS record of a domain to the server, and any session request made with either SIP or XMPP protocol will be bridged to the other side. Project lead: Adrian Georgescu (AG Projects): Website: Project Wormhole About Samizdat The goal of Samizdat is \"to bring public key cryptography to the masses.\" Samizdat aims \"to create a cryptographic system which can be used without any preliminary explanation of cryptography to end-users, and by doing so, push adoption of decentralized public key cryptography to a critical mass. We hope to realize the full social potential of cryptographic web-of-trust systems: a technological revolution of decentralization.\" Samizdat takes the form of a Debian-based GNU/Linux LiveCD providing ready-to-use cryptographic communications channels: email, chat, voice, filesharing, etc., requiring no initial configuration. These LiveCDs self-replicate (producing new CDs), and this self-replication process functions as a fully-automated system for public key distribution, creating a zero-configuration (\"just works\") encrypted virtual private network supporting IPv6. Unlike traditional software distributions, Samizdat does not rely on any trusted third party for its own distribution. Instead, it is based on the biological principle of 'rhizomal growth' -- as exemplified by the Pando tree colony. Samizdat LiveCDs are self-replicating, but instead of the new CD being a clone, separate from and identical to its creator, each Samizdat LiveCD is unique, and serves as a \"digital identity\", much the way a driver's license","title":"Awards","url":"/news/2011/20111201-awards.html"},

{"description":"Awards August 2008 The winners of the August 2008 call are: Anomos Anomos is a pseudonymous, encrypted multi-peer-to-peer file distribution protocol. It is based on the peer/tracker concept of BitTorrent in combination with the onion routing anonymization layer concept of Tor, with the added benefit of end-to-end encryption. By combining these concepts, a platform is being created whereby no party outside of the trusted tracker will have any information about who a peer is or what they are downloading. BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol, but it isn't secure and its users are still actively being pursued and prosecuted. Tor is a popular anonymity tool, but it isn't end to end encrypted, which is dangerous. It is also slow and users are instructed to refrain from using file sharing. Anomos shall overcome these restrictions. General Features of Anomos: File transfers through Anomos are anonymous. After being sent, packets are routed through a number of intermediary nodes before reaching their final destination. These intermediary nodes can only confirm that their neighbours are participating in the network, they cannot confirm that their neighbours are sharing or merely relaying information, nor can they determine what is being shared. Downloading with Anomos is decentralized --the downloader receives parts of the requested file from a number of different sources, similar to how BitTorrent functions. Connections within Anomos are End-To-End encrypted. Communication with the Tracker is also encrypted. DIFR Tag-Scan-Privacy-Match Goal of the project is to develop a demonstrator of a different way to inform consumers about the RFID tags on the items they buy or the tags that surround them in their environment. Main idea is to use a mobile phone to display information about RFID tags in the vicinity. In particular, the setup of the demonstrator operates as follows: A consumer sets his privacy preferences in a profile stored on his mobile phone. If he holds the phone close to a product in a shop containing an RFID tag, the phone will read the tag number from the tag. It will then query (over the Internet, either through GPRS, UMTS or WiFi) the backoffice to retrieve the privacy policy corresponding to the tag number. It will then match the tag policy with the consumer policy, and present the result of the match to the consumer on the display of the mobile phone in an intuitive and appealing manner. This demonstrator will be used to show how such a concept empowers users in deciding for themselves how their privacy is affected and how to respond to that information, and allows producers to efficiently communicate their privacy policy to consumers. The demonstrator will be shown to the public at a special DIFRenz workshop currently being planned at the Balie, Amsterdam, scheduled for October 31, 2008.

The motivation behind development of BGP atomization mechanisms is to achieve potential savings in computation and communication costs (by absorbing routing dynamics of prefixes into coarser grained atoms), as well as reduction in BGP table size (there will be far fewer atoms than prefixes). The project proposal. Item: Refining and Releasing Atom Computation Scripts Objective: Documenting and releasing Andre Broido's Perl scripts for atoms computation. Background: The atoms computation scripts perform two tasks. They derive BGP statistics from the University of Oregon RouteViews `show ip bgp' tables, and they compute BGP policy atoms (groups of prefixes that share the same AS path in each BGP router). Earlier versions of the scripts were used for many of the results in papers authored by Andre Broido et al.: Analysis of RouteViews BGP data: policy atoms Complexity of global routing policies Internet Expansion, Refinement, and Churn Results: The bulk of the original scripts were rewritten for readability and easy usage, code reviewed, and source code and usage documentation were provided. The results have been posted on the Web and can be downloaded from http://www.caida.org/projects/routing/atoms/download/. Announcements were made to a number of mailing lists. The output generated by the scripts include: Atoms: a list of computed atoms, a mapping of each prefix to its atom, and a distribution of prefix counts per atom. A rich set of statistics about ASes, prefixes, RouteViews peers and AS paths. Various AS graphs in text form, intended for further processing. The original BGP table dump in a standard, easy-to-parse format. Ambiguities and irrelevant information have been removed from this file, which will be beneficial for future scripts and programs. Sample of Results: A sample of the results of running the scripts on the RouteViews dump of 1 February 2003 (noon) is given below: Number of prefixes 125857 Maximum number of prefixes per peer in /0-/24 range 119400 Number of prefixes shared by 35 peers 113343 Number of ASes with positive indegree 14754 Number of ASes with positive outdegree 2353 Number of BGP atoms 29059 Number of origin-declared atoms 21771&nbsp;(derived) The above results were computed over the 35 RouteViews peers that carry at least 114000 prefixes (with prefix length 24 or less). The full set of files for this run is also available. The number of origin-declared atoms is actually the number of distinct origin links (first link in the AS path) seen. Declared atoms are discussed later. Current Plan: In their current version the scripts compute `strict' atoms, that is, in strict accordance with the definition of atoms given above. It is our intention to include alternative definitions of atoms (such as `crown atoms' in Analysis of RouteViews BGP data: policy atoms or Complexity of global routing policies ), which better correspond to the atom definition given in the project proposal. The scripts produce many statistics and are written in Perl. Geoff Huston has written an optimised C program which specialises in the task of computing atoms alone. He intends to include atom statistics on http://bgp.potaroo.net/. In addition, a group at Tel Aviv University is researching BGP atoms and have written an independent implementation of atoms computation. Finally, an associate at CAIDA is writing a Python implementation of atoms computation.

{"description":"Atom-Based Routing; description [Improving global internet routing -- concluded on 2003/11/01] Routing protocols such as BGP operate on individual prefixes. Each update, table entry, and computation is based on a single prefix as the basic element. Although several prefixes may be stored or transmitted at a time by BGP, the prefix remains the basic element of the protocol. For example, an update message may carry a route containing several prefixes, but the receiving BGP router will still need to consider each prefix in the message separately in its computations. A routing protocol based on atoms will treat a number of prefixes as equivalent and amortise overhead of the protocol over the equivalent prefixes. Such a routing protocol is the goal of this project. The effects of atom-based routing are similar to CIDR in that both are able to summarise prefixes (as aggregates and atoms respectively) and treat the summary as a unit. An important difference is that CIDR aggregation can be performed independently by each router; however by definition the computation of an atom requires cooperation between many routers. 2002/07: More details about the benefits of Atom-based Routing can be found in the project plan. more&nbsp;&gt;&gt;","title":"Atom-Based Routing; Description","url":"/project/atombr/description.html"},

The project will bring together thousands of organizations, software developers, and software users from around the globe during 2006, in an effort to update the worlds most popular Free Software license. The GPLv3 promises to be one of the largest participatory comments and adoption efforts ever undertaken. The sister organizations in the United States and Europe are also happy to announce a total grant of 150.000&euro; from Stichting NLnet to support this truly unique project. The global process will be overseen by the Free Software Foundation with support from its legal counsel the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC). Free Software Foundation Europe will be coordinating the European activities closely with both organizations and contributing to the global communication effort. Peter Brown, Executive Director of the Free Software Foundation says, \"With the release of GPLv3, we aim to further internationalize the reach of the Free Software movement. To develop this new license, we will be contacting communities across the globe to ensure their participation in the update of one of the most important social documents of our time.\" Georg Greve, President of FSF Europe added, \"We are working closely with our sister organisation and the SFLC to make sure GPLv3 will address the overarching and national European issues,\" and \"Europe has a strong undergrowth of highly skilled Free Software developers and small and medium Free Software enterprises. It will be our goal to strengthen this development and help European governments to build upon it.\" In announcing the grant to the FSF and FSF Europe, Teus Hagen chairman of NLnet said, \"NLnet's support of the GPL and the Free Software movement, and its desire to see the successful adoption of GPLv3 achieved in the spirit of internationalization, made the funding of this project an important priority for us.\" Hagen said, \"We hope to encourage other grant making organizations to help fund this unique project\".

The new SMIL&nbsp;3.0 State Facility allows the state of a presentation to be defined, manipulated at run-time, and then saved. The new SMIL&nbsp;3.0 Timed Text component is a lightweight format that provides the `timed text' data type. In addition to the development of these two new modules, the common Ambulant component was restructured, improving its portability. The `Windows Mobile' code base moved to a more recent version of Windows development tools. The project team expects to include the initial support for the new SMIL&nbsp;3.0 features around the announcement of the Last Call working draft of the SMIL&nbsp;3.0 specification, in July 2007. In the past months, several ways of increasing the impact of the development work were explored. Partnerships with the outside world were build. A quick overview: Within the SPICE project, Ambulant will be used as part of a media demonstrator; The Passepartout project was completed with a very positive final review, where Ambulant played a nice roll in the final demonstrators; Four papers on aspects of the Ambulant work were published; A workshop with Motorola on joined modelling of user interaction in a TV environment is planned. The workshop will be part of ISM in December 2007 in China; Collaboration with PUC-Rio on a new language which supports advanced interaction features has continued.

{"description":"ALIAS; description [Analysing Legal Implications and Agent Information Systems -- concluded on 2003/07] Goal of the research Properties associated to agents such as autonomy, pro-activity, reasoning, learning, collaboration, negotiation, and social and physical manifestation are properties developed by man. Notions such as anonymity and privacy acquire new meanings in the \"digital world.\" New concepts such as pseudo-anonymity emerge. Until now, much research on deployment of information technology has been done as a separate discipline. Computer Science and AI develop the technical expertise and applications. Law then fits these applications into existing legal frameworks (taking US, European and Dutch traditions into account), proposing new frameworks if and when needed. In this project, members of the two disciplines AI and Law are collaboratively investigating the legal possibilities and limitations of agent technology, ultimately leading to recommendations for both disciplines. Discussion Forum Using agents on the internet will eventually lead to many legal questions. Some of those can be foreseen, and specific technical measures may prevent the agent from falling into some legal pitfalls.

Personnel The NLnet AHA project has started on July 1, 2001, when one of the two appointed junior researchers, Natash Stash, commenced work at the TU/e. The second junior researcher, Olga Proskura, will commence work in the beginning of September, 2001, when passport and visa issues will be settled. Apart from personnel employed by TU/e and funded by NLnet some students will also contribute to the project: Jurgen van Westreenen, a 4th year computer science student from TU/e, will be an intern for three months, starting September 1, 2001. At least one masters student from the University of Antwerp will also be working on AHA for their thesis project, during the academic year 2001-2002: Koen Verheyen. Activities and results On July 2, 2001, a metting was organized with the staff members of the Database and Hypermedia group, the NLnet project researcher and one student, to brainstorm about the project goals and a research and development plan. The three main project activities up to now have been: Setting up a source code control system. Using CVS the source code for AHA can now be shared among all people who do development on the software. The CVS tree resides on the IS server. Every developer has a local copy and can run the AHA server on a local PC. The first project goal that has been realized is the possibility for anonymous login. This will first be used for the IShype information system that provides students with information on the procedure for internships and thesis projects. This information system will be available through anonymous login while still exhibiting its adaptive behaviour. The currently ongoing development is creating the possibility for using AHA with documents from external sources. This implies three sub-parts: Making AHA able to retrieve documents from an external source (through URLs) in addition to from the local file system. Changing the behaviour of AHA to no longer automatically generate HTML headers and footers to allow importing documents that already have their own headers and footers Adding an input filter to convert HTML input files to the XML format that AHA reads.

Beschreven worden de verrichte werkzaamheden en het behaalde eindresultaat. Tot slot worden enige conclusies en aanbevelingen geschetst. Werkzaamheden In 2001 zijn door Theo de Ridder en Pim Buurman 14 mensmaanden besteed aan een hybride implementatie in Python en C. Het Python deel is daarbij door Theo uitgevoerd en het C-deel door Pim. Het focus van het Python-deel lag vooral op een omzetting van de gehele GUI naar wxPython om portabiliteit tussen Linux en Win32 varianten te kunnen bereiken. Het prototype waar de oorspronkelijke feasibility study mee getest was, maakte gebruik van de native Win32 faciliteiten van pythonwin. Het focus van het C-deel lag op snelle perfomance van data-manipulaties, datapersistentie en bitmap-operaties. In de herfst 2001 zijn de eerste tussenresultaten als TimeWalker-1.x op sourceforge beschikbaar gekomen. Omdat langzamerhand steeds duidelijker werd dat het vinden van betrokken beta-sites tegenviel zijn diverse pogingen gedaan met presentaties naar buiten te treden. Helaas zijn in 2001 zowel een paper voor LISA als voor SANE afgewezen. Wel is een eigen workshop voor een aantal specifieke belangstellenden gehouden en is een presentatie gegeven op de internationale LINUX-2001 conferentie in Enschede. Op beide bijeenkomsten is positief gereageerd op de concepten en demo's. Een aantal suggesties van de workshop zijn mede in TimeWalker opgenomen. In december 2001 bleek dat het geen toeval was dat er zich zoveel problemen hadden voorgedaan om een goede demo voor de Linux conferentie te maken. Het C-deel bleef zeer crash-gevoelig en de hoeveelheid testwerk om alle problemen te vinden nam exponentieel toe. Op basis van code-inspectie, nieuwe ontwikkelingen in Python en wxPython en een paar performance-experimenten heeft Theo toen besloten om eerst een hernieuwde en betrouwbare pure Python-versie te maken met de gedachte om uiteindelijk ook de hoeveelheid benodigde C-code tot een absoluut minimum terug te brengen. Alleen zo durfde Theo het risico aan om in het resterende budget van 4 mensmaanden toch tot het oorspronkelijk bedoelde resultaat te kunnen komen. Het duurde echter toch nog een behoorlijke tijd voordat in april 2002 versie 2.0.beta beschikbaar kwam. Pogingen om de bestaande contacten voor toegezegde beta-sites met deze versie opnieuw op te warmen wilden echter niet erg aanslaan. Het ging daarbij in eerste instantie om feedback op de functionaliteit en user-interface. Voor de schaalbaarheid naar zeer grote datacollecties was een beoogde C-extensie nog niet ingevuld. Wel is toen van de beta-sites enige testdata verkregen die daarna bij tests steeds als uitgangspunt is gehanteerd. Eind mei is versie beta-2.0.2 als distributie gereleased. Deze distributie was de grondslag voor de (grotere) voorbeelden die voor de poster bij Sane2002 zijn gebruikt. De voorbeelden waren als aparte zip-file aan deze distributie toegevoegd. Verder waren nog wat fouten opgelost, en de user-guide consistent gemaakt met de laatste wijzigingen. Er waren toen wat problemen met het inchecken van de CVS-tree. In juni zijn voor een presentatie op Europython (1e europese Python conferentie) nieuwe fouten gevonden en opgelost die zichtbaar werden bij een poging om Timewalker onder Mac OSX aan de praat te krijgen. Daarbij zijn ook alle regressietests startbaar gemaakt via het standaard menu van TimeWalker. Deze updates zijn eind juli als versie beta2.0.4 beschikbaar gekomen. In augustus en september is nog veel werk verzet om TimeWalker 2.1 als de eindversie van dit project tot stand te brengen. Uiteindelijk bleek dat door slim gebruik te maken van de module"},
{"url":"/project/timewalker/20010423-whitepaper/","title":"Whitepaper TimeWalker","description":"Whitepaper TimeWalker Theo de Ridder, Prometa Ratum bv draft version, april 2001. Introduction Many systems produce huge amounts of time-stamped data (events). Examples are logfiles generated by systemprocesses, time-series generated through network monitoring and transactionlogs generated by (database) applications. In practice most eventdata is thrown away without having been analysed. The main reasons are: saving eventdata requires a lot of resources; formats of eventdata are inconsistent and error-prone; textual formats of logfiles are inadequate for fast manipulation; traditional tools like databases and spreadsheets don't scale for eventdata; methods for analysis are labour-intensive; tools applying information visualisation for events are not available. However throwing away eventdata implicates throwing away history. And without history many ways are lost to discover cause-effect relations within (un)wanted or (un)expected system, user or context behaviour. TimeWalker is a tool that makes storage and analysis of eventdata attractive and feasible enough to enable a more careful attitude towards history. TimeWalker is based on a combination of a smart datamodel and some innovative techniques for information-visualisation along the time-axis. The datamodel unifies arbitrary eventformats for fast aggregations. The visualisation techniques present context and detail simultaneously for data in a range from 40 years down to 10 minutes. The user-interface strategy is focussed on maximizing information-density and minimizing end-user effort. The implementation is made flexible and portable by using wxPython (version 2.2.5) and C. The first releases of TimeWalker will work for Win32 and Linux. In the first release the visualisation is intended to work smoothly for about 100000 events in memory. This events however can be aggregated from a much larger dataset of raw events in a preceding batch-process. Architectural overview The main components of the architecture are: eventmodeller The eventmodeller component transforms any collection of time-stamped data in a unified and compact eventlist. datastore The datastore component facilitates persistence and fast read-access of huge eventlists. aggregator The aggregator component takes care of in-memory transformation of eventlists into evenlists with aggregation of events in equidistant time-intervals. evaluator The evaluator component transforms aggregated events with high-level user-specified expressions into numeric result-vectors. zoomlens The zoomlens component visualizes multiple beams of result-vectors with hierarchical (quarter,week, day, hour,10 min) time-scales. calendar+clock The calendar+clock component shows the beam-data in the familiar shape of a calendar and a clock. treemap The treemap component uses a well-known technique from information-visualization to present composite result-values in a kind of hierarchical (rectangular) pie-chart. dashboard The dashboard component offers instruments for visual-manipulation of the beams and the zoomlens. notebook The notebook component offers multiple pages with textual table/tree views with all details of configuration-data, metadata and the actual eventdata. Event model The eventmodel of TimeWalker was designed with the following properties in mind: efficient to store and manipulate large sequences of events; suitable for straightforward conversions; transparent embedded in Python; enabling clean semantics of aggregations and transformations. An Event represents the basic data-record within TimeWalker. An Event is immutable and is described by a MetaRecord. Alle events described by the same MetaRecord do have the same number of fields. Each Field can be a number, a string or a tuple. The first field is a Timestamp (number of seconds since 1 jan 1970). A sequence of events can be aggregated in an AggrEvent, which contains an AggrValue (min, max, first, last, sum) as value for the original individual fieldvalues. The fields of"},

Introduction NLnet Labs was founded in 1999 by Stichting NLnet to develop, implement, evaluate and promote new protocols and applications for the Internet. The NLnet Labs offices are located in the Amsterdam Science Park (ASP) where traditionally most Internet development in The Netherlands has taken place. The ASP is still very important for the Internet, as it is the location of the Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX), in which vicinity many Internet companies can be found. 2. Activities of Stichting NLnet Labs in 2003 The goal of NLnet Labs is to contribute knowledge to the Internet. This can be achieved by software development, but also by educating people to develop software elsewhere. NLnet Labs' staff therefore not only focuses on software development defined in projects, but also on collaboration with other organisations. The budget of NLnet labs is based on long term (15 years) investment for development with a staff of five to six people. Staff, projects and collaboration are the topics addressed in this section. 2.1 Staff NLnet Labs employed six people in 2003: Alexis Yushin (until 30 november), Miek Gieben, Erik Rozendaal, Ronald van der Pol, Yuri Demchenko (from 1 March until 30 September), and Ted Lindgreen (director) to work on the projects described in the next section. 2.2 The main projects NLnet Labs focussed in 2003 on DNSSEC, NSD, IPv6, Fonkey, and the TestLab. 2.2.1 DNSSEC The DNSSEC project started in 2000 with a study of the scaling issues involved in deploying DNSSEC for large domains. This study proved that DNSSEC scaled better (i.e. less loss of performance) than previously feared by many. This resulted in a renewed interest in DNSSEC. In 2001 the focus was on deployment at TLDs, and a testbed where DNSSEC was implemented in a secure shadow tree of .nl, called .nl.nl, was set up. This work revealed a new scaling issue, namely with respect to the administration of keys at registries. A new record type &quot;DS&quot; (Delegation Signer) was proposed to solve this issue. In 2001 also another change to RFC 2535 was proposed: OptIn. This proposal fundamentally changes the way DNSSEC will be used, as it introduces partial security within a zone. This proposal did not meet consensus in the IETF dnsext working group until mid 2003. At the 57th IETF (Vienna, July 13-18, 2003) it became clear that OptIn would become either informational or experimental. It was also clear that there was consensus to standardize the DS proposal and some other minor issues in a new RFC with working title RFC2535bis. We expect that the new RFC will be ready in Q1 2004. In 2003, NLnet Labs worked on two issues for DNSSEC: 2.2.1.1 A shadow .nl registry After the .nl.nl experiment was completed in mid 2002, a new experiment was started in collaboration with SIDN to gain hands-on experience with running a real secure registry. In October 2003 a fully secure shadow registry for .nl was taken into production. This registry ran completely synchronously with the real .nl registry, with the only difference that it is fully secured and contains DS records for the secured delegations. There are three nameservers, one at SIDN, one at NLnet Labs, and one at the Swedish registry. The .se registry is doing a similar experiment for which NLnet Labs also runs a secondary.

NLnet Labs' staff therefore not only focuses on software development defined in projects, but also on collaboration with other organisations. The budget of NLnet labs is based on long term (15 years) investment for development with a staff of five to six people. The main challenge for 2002 was to increase the number of developers. An additional goal was to increase and improve collaboration with other organisations. By hiring two more developers, setting up a formal (paid for) relation with SIDN, and having NSD running on one of the rootservers (k.root-servers.net) and on a large and important secondary server (ns.eu.net) both goals were accomplished. Staff, projects and collaboration are the topics addressed in this section. 2.1 Staff The 5 developers within NLnet Labs in 2002: Alexis Yushin, Miek Gieben, Erik Rozendaal (started in February), Ronald van der Pol (started in June), and Ted Lindgreen (director) worked on the projects described in the next section. 2.2 Projects NLnet Labs focussed in 2002 on four projects: DNSSEC, IPv6, NSD, and the Query Analyser. 2.2.1 DNSSEC The DNSSEC project started in 2000 with a study of the scaling issues involved in deploying DNSSEC for large domains. This study proved that DNSSEC scaled better (i.e. less loss of performance) than previously feared by many. This resulted in a renewed interest in DNSSEC. In 2001 the focus was on deployment at TLDs, and a testbed where DNSSEC was implemented in a secure shadow tree of .nl, called .nl.nl, was set up.

This proposal fundamentally changes the way DNSSEC will be used, as it introduces partial security within a zone. This proposal did not meet consensus in the IETF dnsext working group in 2001, and also not in 2002. Because of this, NLnet Labs had frozen parts of the work on DNSSEC; in particular the planned release of a BCP (a Best Current Practice document) has to wait until the OptIn issue is resolved, as practice will be very different with or without OptIn. In 2002, NLnet Labs worked on two issues for DNSSEC: 2.2.1.1 A shadow .nl registry The former experiment in collaboration with SIDN, the .nl.nl experiment was completed and closed halfway 2002. A new experiment was set up, again in collaboration with SIDN, this time to run a fully secure shadow registry for .nl. This registry is to run completely synchronously with the real .nl registry, with the only difference that it is fully secured and contains DS records for the secured delegations. There are three nameservers, one at SIDN, one at NLnet Labs, and one at the Swedish registry. The .se registry is doing a similar experiment for which NLnet Labs also runs a secondary. One of the .nl shadow nameservers has recursion enabled. When this server is used as forwarder, the resolver has a secured view on the .nl tree.

{"url":"/project/logreport/2003-annual/","description":"LogReport Annual Report 2003 By Joost van Baal and Wytze van der Raay. [ Report in PDF ] Copyright &copy; 2004 Stichting LogReport Foundation. 1. Introduction Log files are often treated like a wasteful by-product of IT activity: they sit somewhere in a dark corner of a computer system and are only examined occasionally, usually in case of after-the-fact reactive problem solving. This is unfortunate. Log files contain the traces of computer activity, and by intelligently analyzing these traces one can learn a lot about the behavior of a system and its users. Log file analysis is both an essential and tedious part of system administration. It is essential because it's the best way of profiling the usage of the service installed on the network. It's tedious because programs generate a lot of data and tools to report on this data are unavailable or incomplete and when such tools exist, they are specific to one product, which means that you can't compare your Qmail and Exim mail servers. The Stichting LogReport Foundation, a non-profit foundation, founded August 2000, detected this flaw in system administration and chose to serve a dual purpose: developing and maintaining Lire, our Open Source reporting and analysis software, and serving as a nexus of documentation, ideas, and thought on the topic of log files and their potential applications. 2. Activities in 2003 2.1. Introduction We report on the activities of the LogReport team during 2003, LogReport's third full year. A more in-depth overview of what's presented in this document, specifically on Lire development, can be found in the Lire NEWS file, as well as in the various Lire roadmap documents, as shipped with the Lire releases during the year. (There's also a roadmap describing the development plans after August 2003 .) A very detailed journal of changes in Lire is in the Lire ChangeLog file. Some highlights can be found on the LogReport history page too. 2.2. People The main task of the LogReport team is maintenance and development on Lire, LogReport's Free Software tool for performing an integrated analysis of all ones Internet and Intranet Services. Lire does this by automatically generating useful reports from raw logfiles from various services. Next to this work, the team has taken care of administering the LogReport server, hibou.logreport.org. The following changes in the LogReport staff have occured during the year. On February 28, 2003, Joost van Baal's paid contract with LogReport (for 8 hours a week) ended. On June 30, 2003, Wessel Dankers' paid contract with LogReport (16 hours a week) ended. Both Wessel and Joost however plan to continue doing work for the project, by donating volunteer contributions. On May 31, 2003, the agreement between Francis Lacoste and the LogReport Foundation ended. Since August 19, 2003, Francis together with Wolfgang Sourdeau are paid for their work on Lire, under a new contract. Next to these people, involved in the LogReport project by having access to the LogReport server, or being on the logreport@logreport.org alias, are: Josh Koenig, Wytze van der Raay, and Egon Willighagen. At the July 3, 2003 LogReport board meeting, a new board got elected. Teus Hagen will no longer be a member of the board; Joost van Baal was elected as a new board member. Teus however will keep doing work for the project, as an advisor to the board. Wytze van der Raay and Jakob Schripsema will continue their positions in the board. 2.3. The LogReport server The machine hibou.logreport.org hosts our website http://logreport.org/, provides the public LogReport Online Responder service, handles our email, and hosts the 4 public mailinglists: commit@logreport.org, announcement@logreport.org, questions@logreport.org, and development@logreport.org. Furthermore, it hosts a CVS repository for version control of non-public documents and hibou's configuration data. The Lire code development is done using CVS on SourceForge.

There has been a single package release (version 1.0.0) containing several updates available from the project page. The following sections denote updates to the information found in the report dated 14 August, 2002. 1. Major status points 1.1 What's done Development has pretty much stopped, and the system is in a usable and reasonably tested state. As mentioned above, the system is complete enough that a package release has been made, installed and used on several machines. The package contains the sources which must be compiled and installed, a process simple enough on Linux systems where following the README gives a step by step guide. It was briefly noted in the last development status report that there would be no \"magic application\" that knows how to produce containers as part of a Content Provider. In fact, the final sources available contain a reasonably complete toolset for Unix systems to implement a CP: lcccp; this has always existed and provides low-level communication with the UNS. It accepts a set of containers to transmit. lcccpstate; a filter that accepts containers and a state file, and produces a set of containers representing changed content and updates the state file. file2url.sh; a simple shell script that can produce containers describing files when given the filenames. These tools can be used individually or together to form a CP. The UNS, QM, BM and BOT processes, as noted in the previous report, are all functionally complete. The LCC is being integrated with the existing search.nl search engine [[[ and more stuff here, like wamnet etc etc. ]]] What remains to be done There is a TODO list available with the source download that contains a list of technical items that should eventually be actioned; most are very minor or 'like to haves' simply noted in the list so as not to be forgotten. A few of the more major points are the following: The LCC currently only collects HTTP requests. Hooks exist internally in some parts of the LCC for other types of request, such as FTP, but some implementation needs to be done. Security needs to be looked at regarding the communication channel to the UNS (eg, using SSL) and, perhaps, supporting HTTPS for collecting content. The provider password is transmitted and stored in the clear for the moment as well. An investigation should be performed to see if using transactions at the MySQL level provides any degree of extra robustness and, perhaps, implement its use as a run-time option if there are performance implications. Also, the \"Content User\" end of the system is not represented by an API. Actions are performed manually by issuing SELECTs directly on the LCC tables and gathering content directly from local files. A CU \"api\" was not deemed useful at this time until the system has been used by several different parties to give direction to the functionality required. Another idea that we thought of recently that could have far reaching effects, would be the idea to associate category attributes with collections of URLs. The idea would be to invent a set of assigned numbers for category systems, for example \"1\" for dmoz, \"2\" for the dewey system etc. Then clusters of URLs could have 1 or more categories and category systems associated with them. By this process one could provide for a ground roots category system for the internet, libraries etc. Further publicity and securing a future Towards the end of further publicity, we have written a document that provides a technical overview deemed more suitable for publishing as a article on technically oriented websites. At an appropriate time this should be released. Secondly, and more significantly. We have arranged for future development of the LCC protocol within the \"Ingenuus Institute\". This is a Belgium non-profit organisation whose social goal is: \"The promotion of the use of"},
{"url":"/project/lcc/20021014-pr/","description":"The LCC: A Local Content Cache ( PDF version of this text, 50&nbsp;kB) The LCC is a Local Content Cache system facilitating the fetching and storage of network accessable content. There are three parties involved. A \"content provider\" that provides the data (typically a web server), the LCC that stores the data, and a \"content user\" can then interrogate the LCC to retrieve cached content from the local system. Typical users of this system can range from global internet search engines through to central indexers of corporate intranets or universities. The traditional approach to this problem involves spidering with link extraction. This involves continual periodic polling of content to ensure the cache is kept up to date. Advantages found by using the LCC include: Scalability Webpages are only collected when necessary. This provides much more cost effective use of bandwidth and more efficient use of time, allowing more to be indexed with given resources. Changes are noticed immediately Modified items are collected soon after notification implying an up to date index. Modifications are visible in the index typically within a day of changes instead of within weeks or months as with traditional spidering systems. This is a very useful function for news sites which can use automatic notification of change. Website structure is more easily detected With traditional spidering and link extraction, a lot of work is necessary to determine the structure of the website; to find framed pages for example. With the LCC protocol it is possible to specify a \"browse URL\" different from the URL used to retrieve the content directly (the \"fetch\" URL). This mechanism provides flexibility for the use of different future data types as well, reflecting differing \"views\" of the same data. Bandwidth and time of day control With the LCC protocol, it is possible to specify the maximum allowable bandwidth used for fetching content from a site. This may be high for a well connected site, or low for a site with less resources available or dynamically served pages. Additionally, it is possible to specify in detail at what time periods the robot can come calling. Free open source software The software implementing the protocol and a high performance collection system is both open source and free, protected by the GNU GPL license. Where can i get it? The main project page can be found at: http://www.nlnet.nl/projects/lcc/ with LCC source available from sourceforge as the LoCoCa project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lococa. It currently runs on Linux systems. How does it work? In order to create a high performance system and aid scalability, the LCC has several modules that appear as separate processes, as shown below. The main processes have the following functions: CP A \"Content Provider\" process. This is a process run by a registered provider on his own machine that submits changed-URL information to the LCC. UNS The \"Update Notification Server\" process. This is the \"front end\" to the LCC. It accepts an XML stream generated by a CP indicating a set of changed-URL information which is then buffered into local files. It responds to the CP with an XML stream indicating errors (if any) of previous fetches for that provider, the current state of fetching for that provider and current quota information. The buffered changed-URL information is forwarded to the QM if and when the QM is available. QM The \"Queue Manager\" process. This coordinates the fetching and storage of URL data. As such, it places URLs to be fetched into a MySQL table representing a queue and, after the URL has been fetched, updates the main URL repository table. BM The \"Bot Manager\" process. This distributes fetching work to one or more BOT processes or one or more BM processes. There is a single BM process on each machine containing BOT processes (managing filenames for robotting on that machine) and one BM connected to the QM. On small systems where a single machine performs all tasks, it","title":"The LCC: A Local Content Cache"},
{"url":"/project/cp2pc/200205-sane/","description":"Down with hierarchy: File-sharing with CP2PC Ihor Kuz, Patrick Verkaik, Maarten van Steen, and Arno Bakker Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Introduction There are currently numerous peer-to-peer (P2P) networks used for sharing files between clients. Although the various networks generally offer users similar functionality (e.g., searching for files, downloading files, etc.), each such network has its own suite of protocols for communicating between peers and sharing and distributing its files. As such, each network requires the use of its own proprietary client-side software. A user wishing to make use of several of these networks must therefore run several different client applications. Given the similar functionality offered by most such applications, this leads to much repetition of work and frustration. In the cp2pc (pronounced copy to pc) project we tackle this problem in two steps. First we define a unified programming interface to P2P file-sharing systems. Second we use this programming interface to build a single unified P2P file-sharing client. P2P File-Sharing Networks Although the various file-sharing networks offer similar functionality at the user interface level, the lower level details of these networks differ widely. To get a good overview of the various issues involved in P2P file-sharing a number of existing netowrks were studied. These networks were chosen such that they offered a wide variety of features and different network models. We looked at Gnutella, a popular decentralized file-sharing network with broadcast based routing and many different implementations available; mnet, a file-sharing network evolved from Mojo Nation with a credit based file publishing network; jnushare, an application based on Sun's JXTA P2P framework; CFS, which provides a distributed read-only file system based on the Chord P2P research system and GDN, a Globe based software distribution network. A File-Sharing Model Given the differences between the available file-sharing networks, a unified programming interface must provide a single file-sharing model that can be mapped onto each of the individual networks. The basic functionality shared by all the networks studied includes: Files can be published to the network. A published file is available to be downloaded by other peers. Files can be downloaded from the network. Clients can easily join and leave the network. Many of the systems also offer the capability of searching for a file given keywords or attributes. Besides this functionality, all systems can be configured and monitored to some extent, however, the configuration parameters and monitoring details differ widely between systems. A File-Sharing API The file-sharing API that we've developed is based on the concept of files. Files can be published, downloaded and searched for. The API also offers functions that allow networks to be configured as well as monitoring of network status and file uploads and downloads. The API is defined in C, however it has been designed so that it can be implemented in a variety of other languages, including Java and C++. A File-Sharing Application The user application presents a typical file-sharing application interface. It allows files to be selected for sharing (aka publishing), it allows files to be searched for and it allows files to be downloaded. The application can use multiple P2P file-sharing networks simultaneously as shown in Figure&nbsp;1: Figure 1: The CP2PC unified file-sharing client application In this figure, a user request (in this case a publish request) is passed on to each supported network through the unified API. Each network performs the function in its own way. The results are returned to the application, grouped and shown to the user.

Een nieuwe onderzoeksgroep op het gebied van Internettechnologie gaat 1 januari 2000 van start bij de Divisie Wiskunde en Informatica van de Faculteit der Exacte Wetenschappen. De nieuwe onderzoeksgroep Interactive Intelligent Distributed Systems ( IIDS ) zal zich vooral richten op de uitdagingen die het veelvuldig gebruik van globale netwerken (Internet) met zich meebrengen. Technieken uit de Kunstmatige Intelligentie en Gedistribueerde Computersystemen zullen binnen deze groep ge&iuml;ntegreerd worden gebruikt. Zo zal bijvoorbeeld het gebruik van multi-agenttechnologie een belangrijke rol spelen. Schaalbaarheid is een van de belangrijke aspecten waaraan aandacht zal worden besteed. Hoe kunnen bijvoorbeeld onderhandelingen tussen een groot aantal partijen (agenten) het beste worden uitgevoerd? Maar ook: hoe weet een partij van een andere partij dat hij/zij te vertrouwen is? De huidige schaalgrootte van netwerken zoals Internet maken gecentraliseerde oplossingen onmogelijk. Veilige en zelfstandige operaties, verspreid over het netwerk in de vorm van agenten, vormen een goed alternatief. Een gerelateerd gebied is het gebied van anonieme interactie en privacy. Is het mogelijk om bijvoorbeeld iets via het Internet te bestellen zonder alle persoonlijke gegevens aan elke 'winkel' prijs te geven? Zijn er methoden om te voorkomen dat koppeling van beschikbare informatie steeds makkelijker wordt? Motivatie Het oprichten van deze nieuwe groep (onder leiding van een nieuw te benoemen hoogleraar) wordt mogelijk gemaakt door volledige subsidi&euml;ring door Stichting NLnet voor een periode van ten minste 10 jaar. Stichting NLnet's voornaamste doel is het geven van een sterke impuls aan onderzoek op het gebied van elektronische netwerken, waarbij openbaarheid van resultaten in de vorm van 'Open Source' en vrije toepassingen een essenti&euml;le nevenvoorwaarde is. Omvangrijk initiatief Met oprichting van deze groep (parttime hoogleraar, twee onderzoekers, een programmeur en twee aio's) hoopt Stichting NLnet een belangrijke bijdrage te kunnen leveren aan wereldwijde ontwikkelingen op dit gebied. Stichting NLnet heeft de VU gekozen vanwege de daar al aanwezige deskundigheid op het gebied van multi-agenttechnologie, e-commerce en gedistribueerde systemen. Extra momentum voor samenwerking binnen de VU De nieuwe groep zal zich qua onderzoeksonderwerp positioneren tussen Kunstmatige Intelligentie (prof dr J. Treur) en Computer Systemen (prof dr A.S. Tanenbaum) op het gebied van globale netwerken (Internettoepassingen). Andy Tanenbaum (hoogleraar Informatica VU) over de nieuwe groep: &quot;Met deze steun van Stichting NLnet kunnen wij onze positie als een van de beste onderzoeksgroepen binnen de Nederlandse informatica nog versterken. Ik verwacht een vruchtbare samenwerking op het gebied van Internet gerelateerde projecten.&quot; Jan Treur (hoogleraar Informatica VU) over deze impuls: &quot;Deze nieuwe onderzoeksgroep is een belangrijke versterking van ons onderzoek in intelligente Internettoepassingen.&quot; Teus Hagen (algemeen directeur Stichting NLnet) over het initiatief: &quot;Stichting NLnet is opgetogen over deze nieuwe research-stimulans voor Nederland en Internet. Wij zien goede mogelijkheden voor een Internet nieuwe stijl zoals dat momenteel bij de VU wordt ontwikkeld en gaat worden. Anderhalf jaar geleden heeft Stichting NLnet de VU bereid gevonden om te beginnen met de ontwikkeling van een alternatief mechanisme voor de vrije distributie van software over Internet (in de wandelgangen wel eens aangeduid als de tweede generatie Web).

Computer Science University of Nijmegen 6525 ED NIJMEGEN The Netherlands kees@cs.kun.nl http://www.cs.kun.nl/~kees 2 Goal of the project The goal of this project is to make the AGFL linguistic parser generator system publicly available as a tool for the development of NLP-based applications. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology for future web-based applications: from filtering and narrowcasting to more intelligent search machines and services based on the automatic interpretation of the contents of documents. The state-of-the-art in search machines on the web is based mainly on the use of keywords, applying linguistic techniques to enhance recall. An example is the Linguistix software library, incorporated in commercial search machines like Altavista and Askjeeves, which performs tagging, lemmatization and fuzzy semantic matching. Besides individual keywords, some use is made of phrases, but this is mostly limited to those noun phrases which can easily be extracted. An important step forward in precision is to be expected from the use of more complicated linguistic phrases, including the verb phrase. Progress in this respect is hampered by the lack of parsers for natural languages, which can extract and normalize all phrases suitable for Information Retrieval applications, with sufficient speed and precision. Present day natural language parsing technologies are still of limited value to applications: most sophisticated parsers have been developed for mechanical translation rather than for retrieval purposes most parsers are developed using proprietary software, few are in the public domain, so there is little synergy between projects parsing speeds are generally low in relation to the speed of the Internet. That is why there is a need for tools, available in the public domain, and suitable for the development of efficient parsers for Information Retrieval applications. The AGFL system is such a tool. 3 About AGFL The AGFL system is a system for the development of grammars for natural languages and the automatic generation of efficient parsers from such grammars. The AGFL formalism (Affix Grammars over a Finite Lattice) is a notation for Context-Free grammars with finite set-valued features, acceptable to linguists of many different schools. The research group on Compiler Construction at the department of Computer Science of the University of Nijmegen has been collaborating over a long period with the Department of Language and Speech at the same university, supplying syntactic technology (formalisms, parser generators and tools). Based on the experiences obtained in research and teaching with the EAG (Extended Affix Grammar) formalism, in 1991 a simple form of Unification Grammars especially suited for the syntactic description of natural languages was defined: AGFL. This formalism was implemented with subsidy from the Dutch national research organization NWO (SION and ST) in the form of a parser generator with an efficient lexicon builder. Over the last decade, AGFL and the AGFL system have been used for research and development purposes by a number of groups in linguistics and Information Retrieval research: The department of Language and Speech of KUN has developed grammars in the AGFL formalism for English (TOSCA, J. Aarts and N. Oostdijk) and Dutch (AMAZON, J. van Bakel and P.-A. Coppen). On the basis of TOSCA, the ICE grammar of spoken English has been developed and used to construct the ICE treebank, in collaboration with London University. The Dutch grammar Amazon has been further developed in the Esprit project DORO (Document Routing) by J.Potjer and S. van Dreumel and has been integrated into the the LCS system for the automatic classification of human-readable documents. This system has been applied in the routing of mail for an Insurance company. In the same Esprit project large grammars for Spanish and Modern"},
{"title":"Seminar TimeWalker a tool to visualize eventdata","description":"Seminar TimeWalker a tool to visualize eventdata 24 oktober 2001, 15:00 - 17:30 vergadercentrum Hoog Brabant, Utrecht Onderwerp Op het seminar zal voor een klein select gezelschap een demonstratie van een pre-release van Timewalker worden gegeven. Timewalker is een uniek product waarvan een eerste release eind november 2001 onder een GNU Public Licence beschikbaar zal komen. Een samenvatting van de wezenlijke kenmerken is als bijlage bij deze invitatie opgenomen. Motivatie Nu de ontwikkeling TimeWalker zover is gekomen dat de technische claims van de ontwerpers waargemaakt konden worden, richt het seminar zich vooral op het in een stroomversnelling brengen van gerichte feedback vanuit de praktijk. Een van de hypotheses daarbij is dat TimeWalker anticipeert op een latente behoefte die door het ontbreken van vergelijkbaar gereedschap pas kan blijken bij concreet gebruik. Attracties Aan de deelnemers zal een pre-release van het volledige product worden uitgereikt. Van de deelnemers wordt wel enige voorbereiding verwacht omdat TimeWalker vooral tot leven komt voor data uit een herkenbaar domein. Iedere deelnemer krijgt de handreiking om in de week voorafgaande aan het seminar (week 42) representatieve eigen data (of een suggestie daarvoor) aan de projectuitvoerders te doen toekomen. Het recordformaat van de data kan uiteenlopen van XML tot willekeurige tekstregels, zolang ieder record maar een identificeerbare timestamp bevat. Als het om gevoelige informatie gaat, kunnen deelnemers aangeven in hoeverre terugkoppeling anoniem moet blijven naar de andere deelnemers toe. Het seminar heeft overigens beslotenheid als uitgangspunt, dwz er wordt niet over gepubliceerd. Doelgroep Er is gekozen voor gerichte invitaties aan partijen en bedrijven waarvan serieuze belangstelling bekend is. Van de deelnemers wordt verwacht dat deze voldoende strategische of technische kennis hebben om de praktische betekenis in te schatten van een product dat in staat is grote hoeveelheden data visueel te ontsluiten. Aanmelding Aan het seminar zijn geen kosten verbonden. Aanmelding vindt plaats door een reply te sturen naar degene die deze aankondiging als bijlage aan een persoonlijke uitnodiging heeft toegevoegd. Als deze aankondiging u via een andere weg onder ogen komt en u van mening bent ten onrechte niet tot de uitverkorenen te behoren dan kunt u ondergetekende verzoeken alsnog uitgenodigd te worden.

{"title":"Project Proposal Local Content Caching: An Investigation","url":"/project/lcc/proposal/","description":"Project Proposal Local Content Caching: An Investigation Principal Investigators Mr. Gordon Clare, MSc. Mr. Kim Hendrikse, MSc. Mrs. Elizabeth Mattijsen Keywords Distributed information retrieval, meta-search engines, content caching, content processing, intelligent agents. Introduction Centralized search engines, allowing searching of a fraction of the entire internet, are encountering significant scalability problems as servers struggle to keep up with the exponential growth of content providers and the amount of content provided. The main problem for a search engine, or any other content \"user\" for that matter, is keeping an up-to-date (processed) copy of the content of each content provider. Because there is no \"protocol\" for content providers to let search-engines know that there is new content, or that old content has been deleted or updated, search engines periodically \"visit\" the content provider, often fetching content that was fetched before. Valuable resources are used in this process, while the results are still inherently out of date. Another problem is that content providers on the Internet provide content in a form that is good for the human reader, but which is not really ideal for the type of processing needed to create a search engine or similar process. This six month pilot-project will investigate what would be needed to create a system of local content caching, in which a content provider can notify a Local Content Cache of new (or updated or deleted) content. This content will then be collected by that Local Content Cache, possibly in a form more suitable for content processing than the form in which it is presented to the human reader. Such a Local Content Cache can then be used by a search engine, or any other content \"user\" such as an intelligent agent, for its own purposes. A proof of concept implementation of the software needed for a Content Provider, a Local Content Cache and Content Users such as search engines and intelligent agents, will be part of this pilot-project. In the end, the concept of a \"Local Content Cache\" can only be successful if there is a sufficiently well defined \"localization\" of the cache, i.e. which content provider should use which Local Content Cache. In that respect further investigation, and possibly development, will be needed before the Local Content Cache can be really utilized on the Internet as a whole. This further investigation will _not_ be part of this project, but possibly of a follow-up project. However, these issues will be kept in mind when making design decisions in the \"Local Content Caching: An Investigation\" pilot-project. The results of the pilot-project will be utilized - in the first instance - by NexTrieve to build a search engine on top of a Local Content Cache, and by any other party that would want to participate in this pilot-project. Goal The goal of this pilot-project is to create a functioning proof-of-concept in which: one or more Content Providers can notify a Local Content Cache of new, updated or deleted content. a Local Content Cache can then fetch the indicated content from the Content Provider in the manner and at the time indicated by the Content Provider. the content fetched by the Local Content Cache is stored on the server on which the Local Content Cache software modules are running a Content User is able to interrogate the Local Content Cache for a list of new, updated or deleted content. a Content User is able to obtain this content from the Local Content Cache. a Content User such as NexTrieve (or any other Content User that participates in this pilot-project) can be demonstrated to work on the content as provided by the Local Content Cache. Furthermore a description of the software, protocol(s) and API(s) developed for this pilot-project will be provided. Recommendations from the team for further (re-)development of these will also be provided. The question as to whether or not it seems worthwhile to continue the pilot-project"},

Computable Online, &copy; VNU Business Publications 1999. De stichting NLnet start binnen NLnet Labs met het ontwikkelen van Internetsoftware voor het publieke domein. Begin volgend jaar vangen de activiteiten aan. Deze worden gefinancierd met de rente van het bij de verkoop van NLnet aan Uunet verworven kapitaal. Op korte termijn ligt de prioriteit bij het oplossen van enkele bottlenecks in netwerktechnologie voor Internet, zoals het veilig koppelen van domeinnamen met IP-adressen. 'Dit moet niet in handen vallen van commerci&euml;le uitbaters', zegt Ted Lindgreen van NLnet. Lindgreen is mede-oprichter van het in 1988 gestarte NLnet en zal NLnet Labs gaan leiden. Voor het totale initiatief is vijftien jaar uitgetrokken. 'Bij een kortere tijd moet er meer worden gescoord. Met een richtwaarde van vijftien jaar kunnen we echt nieuwe ontwikkelingen gestalte geven.' Onafhankelijk NLnet Holding kwam in 1997 in handen van Uunet, een dochter van MCI Worldcom. Met de aandelenruil die daarbij plaatsvond kreeg de Stichting NLnet de beschikking over een fors kapitaal. Vorig jaar werd besloten de stichting om te vormen tot een instelling tot nut van het algemeen. Doel was het bevorderen van elektronische informatie-uitwisseling via Internet, 'volledig onafhankelijk van overheid en bedrijfsleven', aldus de nieuwsbrief van NLnet in februari 1998. Lindgreen wil 'met een aantal briljante onderzoekers' open source software voor Internet gaan ontwikkelen. Met de rente van het bij de Uunet-overname verworven kapitaal kan NLnet deze ontwikkelingen financieren. Volgens Lindgreen is vooral haast bij het ontwikkelen van de nieuwe versie van Bind (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon). Bind ligt ten grondslag aan alle huidige Internet DNS (Domain Name Service) systemen en zorgt ervoor dat domeinnamen en IP-nummers aan elkaar worden gekoppeld. De nu toegepaste Bind-versies en derivaten kennen nog geen beveiliging en het einde van de schalingsmogelijkheden komt in zicht. 'Ons doel is om versie 9 veilig te maken en op te schalen', zegt Lindgreen. 'In Nederland zitten we nu op 150.000 domeinnamen en dat zal eind 2000 oplopen tot een miljoen. Die groei zie je wereldwijd. Bind versie 9 is het antwoord op beide problemen, maar moet nog wel afgemaakt en breed toegepast gaan worden.' Eerder staken enkele computerbedrijven ook al geld in Bind V9, maar dat project liep aanzienlijke vertragingen op. NLnet sponsort sinds vorig jaar al het Internet Software Consortium (ISC) met een project voor de ontwikkeling van ISC Bind V9. De angst bestond dat bedrijven licenties wilden afdwingen, wat een brede beschikbaarheid in de weg stond. 'Dit zijn de basiselementen van Internet', zegt Lindgreen. 'Daar moet een onafhankelijke organisatie werk van maken.' Hij noemt het 'gevaarlijk' als de basissoftware van het Internet in het domein van gesloten software-bedrijven wordt ingelijfd. 'Dan is het einde van ontwikkeling van Internet in zicht. Gelukkig kunnen we dit nu met eigen middelen gaan doen.'"},
{"title":"Mail::Box -- Phase 1, Final Report","url":"/project/mailbox/20030203-final-1/","description":"Mail::Box -- Phase 1, Final Report By Mark A.C.J. Overmeer, MARKOV Solutions, Arnhem The Netherlands, 3rd February 2003. This text as PostScript or PDF. Introduction Mail::Box is a module for the Perl programming language. It helps programmers to process e-mail message automatically. For instance, Mail::Box can be used to filter incoming unsolicited messages ( spam and viruses), create automatic replies to costumers, search through mail archives, or produce web-based mail applications. Mail::Box is not a user application itself, only a library which facilitates application writers. Mail::Box was created by me, Mark Overmeer, in 2001 as a modern replacement for existing e-mail handling libraries for Perl. It had already grown to quite a large module, in need for a push to market. The NLnet Foundation offered to support the development of Mail::Box for a few months, in which a set of improvements had to be made. These improvements targeted both the implementation and the building of a user's community. This short paper describes the improvements which were realized. Promotion The main focus for this NLnet funded project was to enlarge and organise the user community. A module which has more users will get better, and therefore attract even more users, where a module which does not actively promote itself will eventually diminish. Besides, the module required more involved developers to safeguard continued improvements. A number of promotional activities were launched: One presentation and paper at the SANE2002 Conference in Maastricht. One tutorial and a paper on YAPC::Europe, the yearly European Perl Conference, this time in Munich Germany. A web page which is used as central development location, listing all Mail::Box resources at http://perl.overmeer.net/mailbox/ A mailing-list mailbox@overmeer.net, with (on feb 1st, 2003) 70 members. The mailing list started at May 20, 2002. From then on, in eight months, it processed about 1500 e-mail messages. This is 4 times the number of messages I sent and received related to the module in the eight months before the list started. Most of the mailing list messages are saved in the archive at http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=perl-mailbox. Some discussion threads were not broadcasted to everyone, to avoid list members from being over-flooded with less interesting debates. These messages can not be found in that archive. Next to the standard mailing list, some regular contributors have their own direct link to me, as main implementor. Messages on some Mail::Box related modules are kept separate as well. A simple message count reveals about 300 messages more. This total of 1800 messages in eight months consumed a considerable amount of the project time. Mail::Box had two items on the central Perl story board website, located at http://use.perl.org. Seen the enormous (and growing) amount of messages, it is clear that the number of users is rising. Quality improvements One of the main targets for the project, was to improve the quality of the library. Based on the algorithms of the existing (old) modules, Mail::Box had to be improved to fulfil the requirements of the latest RFCs. Conformance Code improvements have been made in many areas, for instance in the strict protection of the order of header lines, the improved processing of resent-groups, and the handling of messages which are not RFC compliant. These improvements were mainly possible due to the growing amount of users, giving feedback on what they found. Documentation The larger a library gets, the harder it is for users to understand what is happening inside them. Mail::Box defines over 800 methods in 110 classes, which is not easy to grasp. During this project, the organisation of the documentation is re-done. The manual-pages are now partially generated, to help the user understand class dependencies. Available methods are grouped, sorted, and now have a consistent layout. To achieve this, the standard POD document feature of Perl"},
{"title":"ISOC awards NLnet Labs","description":"ISOC awards NLnet Labs [13 September 2006] The Dutch Internet Society (ISOC) has awarded the NLnet Labs Foundation for its work to improve Internet. The category \"Safety and Privacy\" had six nominees, of which the jury decided to reward two. In this category, publicist and researcher Karin Spaink received an award for her efforts to protect personal Privacy. Her book `Medische geheimen' (medical secrets) delayed governmental plans for the introduction of the `Electronisch Patientendossier' (electronic patient files) NLnet Labs received its award for its work on safer internet protocols and its software to maintain domain names. In the words of the jury (only available in Dutch): Al vanaf 1990 was bekend dat het domeinnaamsysteem van het internet technisch gezien erg kwetsbaar was. De DNS wordt door iedereen op het Internet gebruikt omdat het de link is tussen de namen die we typen (zoals isoc.nl) en de eigenlijke nummers die computers gebruiken om elkaar te vinden. Het originele DNS protocol dateert van 1983 en is niet beveiligd. Vanaf 1995 begon het werk aan een veiliger variant, maar dat vlotte maar langzaam omdat er vooralsnog weinig commercieel nut uit betere DNS-protocollen te halen viel. Vanuit Nederland is disproportioneel veel geinvesteerd om dit cruciale onderdeel van internet te moderniseren, enkel voor het algemeen belang. Mede dankzij pionierswerk vanuit Nederland werd ingezien dat er een herziening nodig was van eerdere op tafel liggende DNSSEC protocol, en vervolgens werd actief binnen de internetstandaardenorganisatie IETF bijgedragen aan de succesvolle ontwikkeling en het testen hiervan. De jury heeft veel waardering voor de 'niet praten maar doen'-mentaliteit die de drijfveer is achter de winnaar van de tweede ISOC-award van dit jaar in de categorie privacy en veiligheid, en dat is natuurlijk NLnet Labs. Met het toekennen van deze [tweede] ISOC-award eren wij niet alleen medewerkers en oud-medewerkers van het lab maar alle individuen en instellingen die vanuit Nederland hebben bijgedragen aan het werk aan betere en veiligere DNS-protocollen --als individu en vanuit onder meer SURFnet, SIDN, het Telematica Instituut en natuurlijk de NLnet Foundation die de financiele basis vormt voor het werk van het lab.

{"title":"Internet in nieuw jasje","url":"/news/1999/19991231-parool/","description":"Internet in nieuw jasje De Vrije Universiteit en Stichting NLnet gaan samenwerken bij de ontwikkeling van 'internet nieuwe stijl'. Dat houdt in dat gebruikers meer privacy kunnen genieten, maar ook dat de betrouwbaarheid van gegevens beter wordt gewaarborgd. De resultaten worden voor iedereen beschikbaar. Het project is volgens directeur Teus Hagen van Stichting NLnet uniek voor Nederland, zelfs voor Europa. NLnet financiert een volledige onderzoeksgroep van vijf mensen bij de VU, die zich in elk geval de komende tien jaar richt op onderzoek van 'intelligente agenten', privacy en beveiliging. Welk bedrag daarmee gemoeid is, wil Hagen niet zeggen. Dat zou maar jaloezie opwekken bij andere, minder bedeelde onderzoekers. De stichting NLnet komt voor uit de eerste, gelijknamige, Nederlandse internetaanbieder die In 1997 werd verkocht aan UUnet. De opbrengst, naar schatting tussen de 25 en 30 miljoen dollar, kwam ten goede aan de stichting zelf. Met de opbrengst van het vermogen financiert de stichting allerlei projecten op het gebied van internet. Een voorwaarde is dat de opbrengst van het onderzoek ten goede komt aan het algemene publiek. NLnet houdt daarmee vast aan zijn oorsprong in de minder van commercie doordesemde begintijd van internet. Onder de andere projecten die NLnet subsidieert, zijn een anti-spamprogramma (tegen ongevraagde e-mail) en de ontwikkeling van software die het mogelijk maakt dat veel mensen tegelijk dezelfde bestanden van internet kunnen downloaden. De onderzoeksgroep krijgt een deeltijdhoogleraar, twee onderzoekers, een programmeur en twee aio's (assistenten-in-opleiding) en blijft tenminste tien jaar actief. Dat is lang, in internettermen, maar het ontwikkelen van nieuwe technologie kost al snel vijf jaar, zegt Hagen. Het onderzoek aan de VU richt zich met name op het gebruik van 'agenten'. Agenten zijn stukjes software die het net afzoeken op zoek naar bepaalde informatie. Een agent kan bijvoorbeeld zoeken naar de goedkoopste cd, of alle websites over Harley Davidson verzamelen. Ze worden onmisbaar op het moment dat het internet steeds verder uitdijt, waardoor mensen het overzicht verliezen. Commerci&euml;le bedrijven zien ook wel iets in het ontwikkelen van agenten. ''We willen niet dat een bedrijf het alleenrecht krijgt,'' zegt Hagen. Maar bedrijven kunnen de resultaten van het ontwikkelingswerk van de VU-onderzoekers wel in hun producten inbouwen. Onderzoeksleider Frances Brazier denkt ook aan systemen die het mogelijk maken websites te testen op betrouwbaarheid en hun omgang met privacygevoelige gegevens. Nu test bijvoorbeeld de Consumentenbond webwinkels, maar op den duur wordt het onmogelijk alle sites te testen. Dat moet de computer, of een agent, zelf kunnen doen. Voor veel gebruikers speelt privacy niet zo'n grote rol, vermoedt Brazier. ''Heel veel gaat op basis van goed vertrouwen.'' Het delen van persoonlijke informatie met vertrouwde internetwinkels wordt door veel klanten niet als bedreigend gezien. Maar in de toekomst krijgen mensen bij het elektronisch winkelen misschien behoefte aan een bemiddelaar, denkt Brazier. Deze broker kan ervoor zorgen dat een bestelling bij een webwinkel niet herleidbaar is tot de klant. Anoniem winkelen, net als in een gewone winkel, wordt dan ook op het web mogelijk.

{"title":"Intelligenter Internet met Open Source Sesame","description":"Intelligenter Internet met Open Source Sesame Op 1 maart 2002 starten Stichting NLnet en Aidministrator uit Amersfoort het Sesame project. In dat project wordt Sesame ontwikkeld dat de basis is voor intelligentere Internet toepassingen, het zogenaamde Semantic Web. Het bijzondere van het project is dat Sesame als Open Source software beschikbaar zal komen. Stichting NLnet ondersteunt Aidministrator bij het uitvoeren van het project. Het internet heeft meer intelligentie nodig. Bijvoorbeeld om preciezer informatie te kunnen vinden. Wanneer je weet dat een 'voetenbank' een bijzonder soort bank is, bedoeld om je voeten op te leggen en tot de categorie meubels behoort, dan weet je dat je niet hoeft te zoeken bij financi\\xEBle instellingen. Deze contextuele informatie maakt dat computers beter om kunnen gaan met vragen om informatie. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is een belangrijke, door het W3C gestandaardiseerde taal voor de intelligente representatie van informatie en context. Sesame is een belangrijke bouwsteen voor het Semantic Web omdat informatie met behoud van contextuele informatie wordt opgeslagen. In Sesame kan RDF geannoteerde informatie worden opgeslagen en weer worden teruggevonden. Met behulp van Sesame kunnen applicaties als inteleligente agents, zoekmachines of business portals, hun voordeel doen met deze extra contextuele informatie en hun gebruikers beter en accurater van informatie voorzien. Aidministrator en Stichting NLnet starten een groot Open Source project. In dat project wordt Sesame als Open Source software gedistribueerd. Dat betekent dat ontwikkelaars, bezig met Semantic Web toepassingen, de vrije veschikking krijgen over Sesame. Doorontwikkeling van Sesame wordt gerealiseerd door de bijdrage van een grote groep ge\\xEFnteresseerde bedrijven en instellingen. Ondertekening van de overeenkomst tussen NLnet en Aidministrator vindt plaats op 12 maart in Amersfoort. Aidministrator ontwikkelt technologie en producten voor het Semantic Web. Op basis van deze technologie en producten voert Aidministrator projecten uit bij klanten. Stichting NLnet ondersteunt projecten ter ondersteuning van de Internet gemeenschap. In deze projecten wordt netwerk technologie ontwikkeld die beschikbaar blijft in het publieke domein (Open Source).

{"title":"Annual Report 2004 Stichting NLnet Labs","url":"/project/nlnetlabs/2004-annual/","description":"Annual Report 2004 Stichting NLnet Labs Office: Kruislaan 419 1098 VA Amsterdam The Netherlands e-mail: info@nlnetlabs.nl web: http://www.nlnetlabs.nl KvK: Chamber of Commerce Amsterdam, nr 34126276 1. Introduction NLnet Labs was founded in 1999 by Stichting NLnet to develop, implement, evaluate and promote new protocols and applications for the Internet. The NLnet Labs offices are located in the Amsterdam Science Park (ASP) where traditionally most Internet development in The Netherlands has taken place. The ASP is still very important for the Internet, as it is the location of the Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX), in which vicinity many Internet companies can be found. 2. Activities of Stichting NLnet Labs in 2004 The goal of NLnet Labs is to contribute knowledge to the Internet. This can be achieved by software development, and also by educating people to develop software elsewhere. NLnet Labs' staff therefore not only focuses on software development defined in projects, but also on collaboration with other organisations. The budget of NLnet Labs is based on long term (15 years) investment for development with a staff of five to six people. Staff, projects and collaboration are the topics addressed in this section. 2.1 Staff NLnet Labs employed seven people in 2004: Miek Gieben, Erik Rozendaal, Ronald van der Pol, Martin Pels (from February until July), Jelte Jansen (from March 1), Jaap Akkerhuis (from August 1), and Ted Lindgreen (director) to work on the projects described in the next section. 2.2 The main projects NLnet Labs focussed in 2004 on DNSSEC, NSD, and the TestLab. 2.2.1 DNSSEC The DNSSEC project started in 2000 with a study of the scaling issues involved in deploying DNSSEC for large domains. This study proved that DNSSEC scaled better (i.e. less loss of performance) than previously feared by many. This resulted in a renewed interest in DNSSEC. In 2001 the focus was on deployment at TLDs, and a testbed where DNSSEC was implemented in a secure shadow tree of .nl, called .nl.nl, was set up. This work revealed a new scaling issue, namely with respect to the administration of keys at registries. A new record type &quot;DS&quot; (Delegation Signer) was proposed to solve this issue. In 2001 also another change to RFC 2535 was proposed: OptIn. This proposal fundamentally changes the way DNSSEC will be used, as it introduces partial security within a zone. This proposal did not meet consensus in the IETF dnsext working group until mid 2003. At the 57th IETF (Vienna, July 13-18,) it became clear that OptIn would become either informational or experimental. It also was clear that there was consensus to standardize the DS proposal and some other minor issues in a new RFC with working title RFC2535bis. The new (proposed) standard was ready in 2004, but it took until Q1 2005 until it was finally published as RFC 4033, 4034 and 4035. In 2004, NLnet Labs worked mainly on DNSSEC deployment, which is work without much visibility. Part of the work was promoting DNSSEC deployment by actively participating in various fora like IETF, RIPE, ISOC-international, and the DNSSEC deployment group. Most of this work is done by Jaap Akkerhuis. The other part was to build secure aware tools: a demo-resolver (Martin Pels), a DNSSEC debugging tool (Miek Gieben and Jelte Jansen), and a library with various DNSSEC tools ( ldns ). The .nl experiment was closed on 28 December 2003, after we concluded that there are no more showstoppers in the proposal for RFC2535bis. After this, it appeared that SIDN had lost interest in further testing DNSSEC deployment. Hopefully this will change in the future. 2.2.2 NSD NSD is nameserver software aimed at usage on large and/or important authoritative nameservers, such as the root-nameservers and TLDs. The idea to write this software came up at the RIPE 40 meeting in October 2001 in Prague, Czech Republic. It was observed that all rootservers and most TLDs were converging to use exactly the same software:"},

Introduction Log files are often treated like a wasteful by-product of IT activity: they sit somewhere in a dark corner of a computer system and are only examined occasionally, usually in case of after-the-fact reactive problem solving. This is unfortunate. Log files contain the traces of computer activity, and by intelligently analyzing these traces one can learn a lot about the behavior of a system and its users. Log file analysis is both an essential and tedious part of system administration. It is essential because it's the best way of profiling the usage of the service installed on the network. It's tedious because programs generate a lot of data and tools to report on this data are unavailable or incomplete and when such tools exist, they are specific to one product, which means that you can't compare your Qmail and Exim mail servers. The Stichting LogReport Foundation, a non-profit foundation, founded August 2000, detected this flaw in system administration and chose to serve a dual purpose: developing and maintaining Lire, our Open Source reporting and analysis software, and serving as a nexus of documentation, ideas, and thought on the topic of log files and their potential applications. 2. Activities in 2004 2.1. Introduction We report on the activities of the LogReport team during 2004, the LogReport Foundation's fourth and last full year. A more in-depth overview of what's presented in this document, specifically on Lire development, can be found in the Lire NEWS file, as well as in the various Lire roadmap documents, as shipped with the Lire releases during the year. A very detailed journal of changes in Lire is in the Lire ChangeLog file. Some highlights can be found on the LogReport history page too. 2.2. People The main task of the LogReport team is maintenance and development on Lire, LogReport's Free Software tool for performing an integrated analysis of all ones Internet and Intranet Services. Lire does this by automatically generating useful reports from raw logfiles from various services. Next to this work, the team has taken care of administering the LogReport server, hibou.logreport.org. The following changes in the LogReport staff have occured during the year. Since August 19, 2003, Francis Lacoste together with Wolfgang Sourdeau are paid for their work on Lire; the contract specifies a Lire 2.0 release, and is valid till full completion of such a release. Next to these people, involved in the LogReport project by having access to the LogReport server, or being on the logreport@logreport.org alias, are: Joost van Baal, Wessel Dankers, Wytze van der Raay, and Egon Willighagen. (In September 2003, Josh Koenig left the project.) During 2004, the LogReport board consisted of Joost van Baal (chairman), Wytze van der Raay (treasurer) and Jakob Schripsema (secretary). Teus Hagen is an advisor to the board. 2.3.

The exchange would be for a period of 4 months, to conduct research on the automatic construction of electronic dictionaries for use in text mining and related applications using memory-based learning techniques. Description of the Sending Institute The ILK (Induction of Linguistic Knowledge) group at Tilburg University was founded in 1995 by Walter Daelemans to study the combination of machine learning and language processing from the perspectives of language technology, linguistic discovery, and cognitive modeling. The group (currently with a staff of 14) is co-directed by Walter and Antal van den Bosch, has received funding for about 15 projects funded by NWO (Dutch NSF), SOBU, STW, and other agencies, and has a high publication output, mainly in the areas of computational linguistics and machine learning. Description of the Receiving Institute The NLIP group in the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge has been working on natural language processing and information retrieval for nearly 40 years. Ted has been a member of the group for over 15 years, has been PI/Coordinator of 9 national or EU funded grants, and has published around 50 articles. The automatic construction of electronic dictionaries for use in text processing applications has been a research theme for much of this time, beginning with Karen Sparck Jones' work on machine-readable thesauri in the 60s. Description of the Student Sabine studied Computational Linguistics at the University of Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany. During her studies, she worked as a student assistant at the Language Technology Lab of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Saarbr&uuml;cken on an electronic German dictionary. Her master's thesis was on building a tool for the semi-automatic validation of the subcategorisation information contained in this dictionary. After graduating in 1997, she started work as a PhD student in the ILK group in Tilburg. Her research focus is on the use of memory-based learning techniques for shallow parsing, especially grammatical relations finding, in English texts. A shallow parse can be the basis for such different applications as question-answering or subcategorisation extraction. The memory-based learning algorithm has not been used for relation finding before, so research includes finding the best task definition, algorithmic settings and feature representation. Research Exchange Plan One strand of work on electronic dictionary construction at Cambridge involves automatically subcategorising verbs according to the number and type of syntactic arguments they take and how these arguments contribute to meaning. An electronic dictionary containing such subcategories of verbs is a critical component for text mining, information extraction, web-based question-answering and many other text processing systems. However, extant systems make little or no use of subcategories because of the difficulties of learning them reliably. Such dictionaries must be dynamic objects which are continuously modified via processing of new input as subcategorisation is closely linked to verb sense which varies between topic and genre as well as over time. Constructing verb subcategorisation dictionaries automatically from free text is non-trivial because it requires partial parsing of the phrases around occurrences of a given verb to identify potential arguments and their heads, differentiation of arguments from adjuncts, and identification of the mapping of arguments to the representation of the event or situation denoted by the verb.

{"url":"/project/rex/200002-VU-UC/20001001-final.html","description":"Summary of IRDP Research Exchange (February - July 2000) My first task was to get familiar with the source code of the Globe Location Service (LS) prototype since I would be working with it throughout my stay at the VU. The LS was having poor response times (~3ms) to lookup and update operations, even when there was no disk I/O or network latency between the resolver and the LS node (both running on the same machine). Thus, the most productive way to understand how the LS worked was to try to find where all this time was being spent. I worked on this for about 1 month: learning about each logical layer in a node (Datagram, Messenger, RPC and Operation), running the Java profiler, and inserting my own timers throughout the code. Unfortunately, I was not able to find any one function or object that was extraordinarily slow. The 3ms response time appeared to be equally distributed throughout the logical layers. However, during this preliminary investigation, I did become comfortable enough with the code to be able to add serious modifications to it. The LS prototype lacked 2 components that had been designed and published in research papers: crash recovery and node partitioning mechanisms. Crash recovery deals with the loss of update operations, and node partitioning splits a logical node into many physical ones for load distribution purposes. Implementation of these was relatively straightforward; for details of the algorithms, see the papers (which can be found at www.cs.vu.nl/globe/ ). However, one minor problem appeared when I went to merge the code of these 2 components. Originally, we thought that crash recovery and node partitioning were independent of each other, which led to a design that placed the partitioning algorithms in a new layer between the Messenger and RPC layers. The layers below the partitioning layer dealt only with physical nodes, and those above it dealt with only logical ones. However, the crash recovery mechanisms were mainly located in the RPC layer, but handled only physical nodes. Therefore, the partitioning algorithms had to be placed into the RPC layer. Soon after I had completed the merge, we discovered that the crash recovery algorithms were partially incomplete. The paper describing crash recovery (and what I based my implementation on) dealt only with the loss of update RPCs but not lost lookup RPCs. In the prototype, if a reply to a lookup request was lost, the request would stay in the node's memory forever. To prevent lost replies from using up a node's resources, I added a time-out mechanism for RPC requests. When a time-out occurs, the request and associated objects are removed from the node. I'd estimate that I spent 3 months during this phase of the exchange: implementing crash recovery and partitioning and merging them, implementing RPC time-outs, and lots of testing. The final 2 months of the exchange I spent working on a more serious performance analysis of the LS node. Instead of looking at absolute times as before, this analysis focused on comparing the relative execution times of the logical components within a single node. These included: RPC ordering and reliability, partitioning, disk I/O, etc. By comparing the time spent in each logical component, we hoped to find the performance penalties associated with the trade-offs made during the LS design. For example, the high-level lookup and update operations are made simple by having complex RPC and Messaging layers. A list of the all experiments performed, along with a more detailed summary of the analysis can be found at www.cs.vu.nl/~ldcrawl/perf. Briefly, for the experiments involving a database on disk, disk I/O was the major bottleneck. Possible ways to improve this are optimizing the underlying disk database (easy), and making the LS node concurrent for operations on different object handles (hard). I also performed experiments using an in-memory database. Unfortunately, the node only appeared to speed up by a factor of 2-3,","title":"Summary of IRDP Research Exchange"},

Introduction NLnet Labs has been founded by Stichting NLnet to develop, implement and promote new protocols and applications for the Internet. It started its activities on January 1st, 2000 with two employees: Ted Lindgreen and Roy Arends. The NLnet Labs offices are located on the Amsterdam Science Park (ASP) where traditionally most of the Internet developments in The Netherlands have taken place. The ASP is still very important for the Internet, as it is the location of the Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX), in which vicinity many Internet companies can be found. 2. Activities of Stichting NLnet Labs in 2000 2.1 Staff The goal of NLnet Labs is to contribute knowledge to the Internet. This can be achieved by doing development, but also by educating people to develop software elsewhere. The budget of NLnet Labs is based on long term (15 years) development with up to six people. The initial goal was to hire three people (including the managing director) before the end of 2000. During the year 2000 it became clear that it was difficult to find people with the skills NLnet Labs needs. Miek Gieben was an exception, and started in June. However, in November, Roy Arends left to start work for Nominum where he continues to work on DNS development. 2.2 Projects NLnet Labs had planned to start with development of fundamental, low level, issues of the Internet Protocol. There were two reasons for this: in the opinion of both the Board and the managing director, there is currently too little progress on the lower level, and second, the development of higher level protocols would require other skills than presently available within NLnet Labs. One of the lower level protocols that is of special interest is DNSSEC. The current Domain Name System (DNS) works very well and highly efficiently, but lacks security. This problem was first noticed back in 1990, but it took until 1995 before this became a widely known issue. It took until 1999 before a workable proposed standard (RFC 2535) was completed. However, much concern remained, as to whether the proposed standard could be employed in real life, especially by large top-level domains (TLDs). NLnet Labs started investigating the implementation problems of DNSSEC in a CENTR (Council Of European National Top-Level Domain Registries) working group with active participation by the registries for the .nl, the .de and the .se TLDs. One of the first things that was discovered, was that the requirements on CPU power, memory, I/O throughput, etc., needed to sign very large zone-files (.nl had at that time about half a million, .de 5 million, and .com some 25 million delegations) could be met with off the shelf available PC hardware. Many had feared for signing sessions of weeks even with the largest systems currently available. This result was presented at various meetings and conferences (SANE, NLUUG, IETF, RIPE, CENTR), and caused the large TLDs to regain interest in DNSSEC. Next focus was on the operational issues that large TLDs will be faced with when implementing DNSSEC. Again, the results were presented at various meetings, and also published in a science report at the KUN (Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen). The software used to test DNSSEC operations is BIND, versions 8 and 9. The development of this software is co-ordinated by ISC (Internet Software Consortium) and its implementation subcontracted to Nominum. 2.3 Plans for 2001 In 2001 NLnet Labs plans to continue the DNSSEC development. Especially designing and implementing secure aware resolver software, which is currently still non-existing, but badly needed to test the DNSSEC operations. Finding skilled developers will most likely become less difficult in the course of 2001 due to demise of the internet hype. When more developers have"},

This paper gives an introduction to Lire, LogReport 's tool for performing an integrated analysis of all your Internet and Intranet Services. Log files contain the traces of computer activity, and by intelligently analyzing these traces you can learn a lot about the behavior of a system and its users. However, log file analysis is tedious because programs generate a lot of data and tools to report on this data are unavailable or incomplete. In cases where such tools do exist, they are quite often specific to one product, which means that you can't compare your qmail and Exim mail servers. As a result, rotate is quite often the only application dealing with the logs. 1. Lire The LogReport project tries to tackle the problems as outlined above by developing Lire. Lire is a software package to generate useful reports from raw log files of various network programs. Lire is Free Software released under the GNU GPL. The package is actively being maintained by the LogReport team, which currently consists of five experienced software developers. The development can be followed live on our CVS on SourceForge. A new release gets shipped almost monthly. Lire runs on four different Unixen, GNU/Linux included. Since it's written in Perl, porting to different platforms is easy. Lire is shipped as a tarball ( autoconfiscated ), as an RPM and as a Debian package. A FreeBSD port package is available too. Figure 1. Lire's Architecture Lire enables you to schedule hardware upgrades, detect anomalities in usage from services. It can be used as a tool in building a traffic-based accounting system for external customers. It gives insight in who's talking to who, which is valuable for marketing and business planners. >Lire currently supports log files from www (apache, IIS, Boa) dns (bind v8 and v9 querylogs) firewall (cisco IOS, Linux ipchains ipfilter and iptables, BSD IP Filter, WELF from Webtrends) email (Exim, Postfix, qmail, sendmail, Netscape Messaging Server, ArGoSoft) print (CUPS, LPRng) ftp (ProFTPD, WU-FTPD, MS IIS) proxy (squid, WELF proxies, MS ISA) database (MySQL) Lire also supports various output formats for the generated reports: HTML, XHTML, XML, PDF and plain ASCII. Some of these formats support graphical representation of the data. Lire represents the log file in a DLF file (for Distilled Log Format). This is a simple space-separated line-oriented ASCII file. Each logged event is represented by one fixed-fields line. A service coincides with one well-defined raw log file format. Each service has its 2dlf -convertor. A superservice is a class of applications which share the same DLF format, and which will give the same reports. A Lire report consists of several subreports, which can be displayed in graphical form, or as a table. A lot of subreports (144, as of march 2002) come with Lire predefined, but of course you can define your own reports. A report definition is written in the Lire Report Specification Markup Language; it looks like e.g. [...] &lt;lire:report-calc-spec&gt; &lt;lire:group sort=\"-mail_volume\" limit=\"$domain_to_show\"&gt; &lt;lire:field name=\"to_domain\"/&gt; &lt;lire:sum name=\"mail_volume\" field=\"size\"/&gt; &lt;/lire:group&gt; &lt;/lire:report-calc-spec&gt; [...] We plan to ship Lire version 1.0 in June 2002. This release will enable the merging of reports stored in a report datawarehouse, in order to solve problems one frequently encounters in complex networked environments. Lire&nbsp;1.0 will offer industry-strength log file analysis. Figure 2. A subreport from the www superservice. LogReport offers an Online Responder service. You can send (compressed) logfiles in email messages to dedicated addresses, like &lt;log@postfix.logreport.org&gt; and get a report back as a response. Optionally, you can anonimize the log before submitting it, using a simple script which comes with Lire. Logs can be submitted via an HTTP file upload"},

Activities in 2001 2.1 Introduction We report on the activities of the LogReport team during 2001. The main task of this team is maintenance and development of Lire, LogReport's tool for performing an integrated analysis of all ones Internet and Intranet Services. Lire does this by automatically generating useful reports from raw logfiles from various services. Next to this work, the team has been doing promotional activities like writing articles, giving presentations and maintaining the website. Finally, the team has been administering the LogReport server. LogReport's server, called hibou.logreport.org, is hosted at VIA Networks in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The machine hosts the LogReport website http://logreport.org/, handles LogReport email, and hosts the 4 public mailinglists: &lt;commit@logreport.org&gt;, &lt;announcement@logreport.org&gt;, &lt;questions@logreport.org&gt;, and &lt;development@logreport.org&gt;. Furthermore, it hosts a CVS repository for version control of non-public documents and hibou's configuration data. The Lire code development is done using CVS on the SourceForge Open Source Development servers, http://sourceforge.net/projects/logreport/. Various developers' meetings took place: On March 24th, there was a meeting at Jan Stap's place in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, attended by Joost, Jan and Egon. On May 8th, Joost, Egon and Wytze met at Joost's place in Eindhoven. On July 4th, Joost, Francis, Christoph and Egon met at the Libre Software Meeting in Bordeaux, France. All other developers' communication was done using email and IRC. A more in-depth overview, specifically on Lire development, can be found in the various Journal and Roadmap documents, which were presented at the board meetings in June, September and November 2001. A detailed list of the improvements on Lire can be found in the Lire NEWS file. Some highlights can be found on the LogReport history page on http://logreport.org/about/history.php too. 2.2 People The year was started with Joost van Baal working for LogReport, 3 days a week. Furthermore, Anton Holleman, Peter Huisken, Gerrit Nijhuis and Jan Stap did work for the LogReport project on a volunteer basis. During the entire year, Teus Hagen, Wytze van der Raay and Jakob Schripsema formed the LogReport Foundation's board. Since only Joost could spent a large amount of time on LogReport work and Lire development, more contributors were welcome. In January, we started advertising vacancies. We've been talking to quite a few candidates. In February 2001, Egon Willighagen from Nijmegen, The Netherlands joined the LogReport team. Especially his background in"},

The conference was scheduled for May 23 until May 25, so there were 6 weeks left for preparation. Those six weeks were used very effectively using a lot of spare time. We decided upon a name, put up a web site with a report responder, prepared a presentation and started to find funding for our activities to ensure continuity after the conference. Teus Hagen and Wytze van der Raay of Stichting NLnet were contacted and became interested. The first meeting with NLnet took place on April 21 and NLnet received the first LogReport startup plan on May 5. 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;SANE 2000 May 25 was the first public appearance of LogReport during a 45 minutes BoF timeslot from 9:30 until 10:15. About 30 people gathered and Peter Huisken did a great presentation job. A simple example of hungry and thirsty people, pizza's and beers served nicely to explain the power of the Distilled Log Format. After 45 minutes we were still answering questions. Luckily the time slot after our presentation was not used. We left the meeting room at 11 o' clock with a great feeling of excitement because the response and attention was way beyond our expectations. 2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing the license After the conference we had to decide upon a license for the software. We evaluated numerous licenses and spent many long evenings on the topic. Teus Hagen had regularly stated that the GPL is the best license to ensure that LogReport remains Open Source. But an attractive alternative was provided by the BSD license. We could never reach consensus because both licenses had pros and cons. One evening we chose for the BSD license. A few meetings later, the topic was discussed again endlessly. Anton then decided to go for the GPL because this is the mostly used license that does not scare off developers. (At that time mySQL migrated to GPL just to attract developers). Edwin Groothuis was unhappy with this decision because he felt GPL was chosen to please NLnet and he soon left the project. 2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Building an organization We then came into a phase that we had to"},

A significant problem for a search engine, or any other content &quot;user&quot; for that matter, is keeping an up-to-date (processed) copy of the content of each content provider. Because there is no &quot;protocol&quot; for content providers to let search-engines know that there is new content, or that old content has been deleted or updated, search engines periodically &quot;visit&quot; the content provider, often fetching content that was fetched before. Valuable resources are used in this process, while the results are still inherently out of date. Another problem is that content providers on the Internet provide content in a form that is good for the human reader, but which is not really ideal for the type of processing needed to create a search engine or similar process. This six month project investigates what is needed to create a local content caching system, in which a content provider can notify a Local Content Cache of new (or updated or deleted) content. This content is then collected by that Local Content Cache, possibly in a form more suitable for content processing than the form in which it is presented to the human reader. Such a Local Content Cache can then be used by a search engine, or any other content &quot;user&quot; such as an intelligent agent, for its own purposes. It is intended that the Local Content Cache software can be used as a single node in a set of non-overlapping distributed collection points. This is in contrast to the monolithic method of collection used today, where content is directly spidered to a single central location. The diagram above shows the main processes in more detail. The main entities are: User Reg A person performing the initial registration process. RS The Registration Server. CP A Content Provider submitting URL information. UNS An Update Notification Server. These processes accept sets of URLs from Content Providers. UNSDB Update Notification Server Database. This is used if the QM is not available. PIDB The Provider Information Database. QM The Queue Manager. This process orchestrates URL fetching. QDB The Queue Database. There is one record per URL to be fetched. QPSDB The Queue Provider Set Database.

Over the last two years OpenBGPD became a viable alternative to commercial and open-source BGP implementations. Together with OpenOSPFD it is possible to build OpenBSD based routers that can be deployed into the network infrastructure. While most basic setup can be covered with an OpenBSD router running OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD newer routing concepts like policy and multi-path routing and complex customer VPN setups are not supported. The kernel routing code is still based on 4.4BSD and lacks important features. Additional kernel support and features for the routing daemons are needed to cover these areas. To accelerate the development process a mini-hackathon focused on routing support was hold from 14-18 June in Hamburg, Germany. five developers from Europe and one from Australia attended this hackathon. The purpose of the r2k6 was to get the complex projects started and probably finish one task that was already half-way done. The focus was on the following three main projects: equal cost multi-path routing policy routing routing priorities While there was already some multi-path code in OpenBSD it was not used because the final but most important bits were missing. Christopher Pascoe implemented these last bits during the r2k6. He made the code even a bit better. Instead of the simple modulo-n hash he implemented the hash-threshold mechanism to select paths based on source/destination IP address pairs. Additionally multipath routes are now inserted in the middle of the list of the multiple paths. This more complex mechanism to select and insert routes was chosen to keep the impact on flows in case of route changes small and follows the recommendations made in RFC2992. Multi-path routing needs to be enabled via sysctl this safety barrier was added because having multiple paths to the same destination in the routing table may confuse user-land programs. Henning Brauer took the lead in implementing policy routing. He implemented a way to have multiple routing tables concurrently in the network stack. Additionally, with Hans J&ouml;rg H&ouml;xer he developed a way to tag packets via the pf(4) packet classifier. pf(4) adds a mbuf tag to each packet this tag can be used to chose the corresponding routing table. Currently it is only possible to tag packets but the necessary hooks to evaluate this tag have not yet been addedto code. During the implementation some problems where identified resulting in a couple of interesting discussion rounds. When using multiple routing tables one issue is where to store Layer 2 addresses. Arp entries are stored as host routes in the routing table. With multiple tables it is possible to either use the main routing table for these link-local addresses or adding them to each routing table on demand. Using the main table is easy to implement --no hooks in the link layer specific code is needed-- but this has some drawbacks. It is not possible to have the same IP in two or more routing tables with different link-local address. This is needed to support multiple VPN on one system. So we decided that every routing table instance needs its one link-layer information. A result of this decision is that ifconfig(8) needs a way to know into which table a interface needs to be added. Another issue was how to access these additional tables via the routing socket. By default multiple tables should not be visible to a listener --a socket option is needed to enable reception of these additional messages. This is the only way of implementing multiple tables without causing compatibility issues. Claudi Jeker started with the third big project --routing priorities. The idea of routing priorities is that each user-land routing daemon has a specific priority. It is possible to","title":"OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD mini hackathon r2k6, report"},

Two conference rooms were turned into hacking rooms, stuffed with machines, network equipment, and the like. Lots of work was done on the OpenBSD system, and grounds for bigger sub-projects were laid. The greater part of the changes found in OpenBSD release&nbsp;3.4 are visible results. Some of these in detail: Kernel Stack Overflow Protection Since we added a stack overflow detection scheme in the system compiler, and have been compiling the whole userland with this, the next logical step was to extend this to the kernel itself as well. It turned out that there were less hurdles than expected, and this was eventually commited. I shortly later added the ability to force the kernel to be compiled without Propolice, mainly for installation media where the kernel code size matters a lot. The console/framebuffer framework on sparc and sparc64 was unified, and support for some more framebuffers was added. Mozilla was made working on OpenBSD. Many improvments in the SMP code. For the first time, both processors in the development machine (dual Athlon) were actually made usefull. Hammer support: the grounds for supporting the AMD64 architecture were laid. OpenBSD/amd64 basically works, but quite a bit of polishing is still required unless it becomes a self-hosted environment. Official support will most likely show up in OpenBSD 3.5. US&nbsp;III improvements: machines with the Sun UltraSPARC&nbsp;III processor can now boot into single user mode. Many improvements in pf, our packetfilter: support for arbitary packet tags was added, allowing to split classification and policy, as well as drawing cross-interface trust relationships, and much more. after the hackathon tagging support was added to the bridge code so that the bridge filters can now work as classifier for pf. adaptive timouts: decreasing timeouts with increasing number of state table entries help in preventing state table exhaustion. synproxy: a generic synproxy was added, helping to fight syn floods ...and as usual, tons of small improvements. Besides these, lots of ideas where born and get implemented over time. And of course there was quite some social life. Beside going out for beer most evenings -&nbsp;actually, lots of good ideas where born there&nbsp;-, there were some social events: The Plaid Tongued Devils, the band behind the songs on the OpenBSD CDs, played a concert for us a trip to Banff, hiking at Tunnel Mountain viewing \"Matrix: Reloaded\" the traditional Moose BBQ at Theo's house Because DARPA suddenly and unexpectedly cancelled funding for OpenBSD R&amp;D, covering the hotel and travel costs for the 2003 hackathon was a problem. Nevertheless the event happened as scheduled with donations and contributions by companies and the user community continued to support the project. We would like to thank especially the Stichting NLnet for covering the hotel costs of this event, without their support, it would not have been possible to organize the event at this scale."},

{"url":"/project/atombr/200207-plan/4.html","title":"Atom-Based Routing","description":"Atom-Based Routing 4. Atom-Based Routing Routing protocols such as BGP operate on individual prefixes. Each update, table entry, and computation is based on a single prefix as the basic element. Although several prefixes may be stored or transmitted at a time by BGP, the prefix remains the basic element of the protocol. For example, an update message may carry a route containing several prefixes, but the receiving BGP router will still need to consider each prefix in the message separately in its computations. A routing protocol based on atoms will treat a number of prefixes as equivalent and amortise overhead of the protocol over the equivalent prefixes. Such a routing protocol is the goal of this project. The effects of atom-based routing are similar to CIDR in that both are able to summarise prefixes (as aggregates and atoms respectively) and treat the summary as a unit. An important difference is that CIDR aggregation can be performed independently by each router; however by definition the computation of an atom requires cooperation between many routers. Figure&nbsp;4 illustrates the general idea behind atom-based routing as applied to the example in Figure&nbsp;2 The atoms shown are those derived in Figure&nbsp;3. In Figure&nbsp;4, advertisements of atoms replace advertisements of individual prefixes. As a result, the number of update messages in the backbone has decreased from six to four, and the number of entities advertised into the backbone has decreased from five to three. This is one example of how an atom-based routing protocol might take advantage of the equivalence of the prefixes in an atom. Note that this example assumes that the routers involved know what prefixes make up each atom, i.e. have some of means of knowing the mapping in Figure&nbsp;3. Figure&nbsp;4: Example of atoms. 4.1. Dimensions of Atom-Based Routing Protocols A number of atom-based routing protocols are possible, varying in a number of dimensions, some of which are: Scope of atoms Computing atoms in a large system of BGP routers may run into scalability problems. Possible scalability problems are: Determining the precise set of equivalent prefixes that make up an atom may require taking a global snapshot of all BGP routers in the system. For systems consisting of many routers, this may be too expensive. If the messages of the atom-based protocol contain references to atoms, the routers involved in a message exchange need to agree on what atom is being referred to in the message. In other words, the routers need to have a common naming (identification) system of atoms. Establishing a common naming system among all the routers in a large system may be too expensive. These problems may be diminished by limiting the scope of an atom. For example, an atom-based protocol might divide a large system of BGP routers into smaller `areas', and compute atoms independently in each area. The scope of an atom then consists of the area it is computed in. The more areas the system is divided into, the smaller each area will be, and the cheaper it will be to manage the atoms of that area. However, there is a trade-off, in that the more areas the system is divided into, the less useful each atom may be to the system as a whole. Knowledge of prefixes An atom-based routing protocol may be able to do away with the knowledge of the individual prefixes that compose an atom (i.e. a mapping such as the one shown in Figure&nbsp;2 in a subset of the routers. An example appears in Section&nbsp; 5.1. Alternatively, even if knowledge of individual prefixes continues to be maintained by each router, an atom-based routing protocol allows large tables to be taken out of the critical path during packet forwarding. This capability is examined in Section&nbsp; 5.2. 4.2. Benefits of Atom-Based Routing Benefits in one or more of the following areas are to be expected: Table size If each entry in a router's table governs an atom rather than a single prefix, fewer entries need to"},
{"url":"/project/atombr/200207-plan/2.html","title":"Atom-Based Routing; Background","description":"Atom-Based Routing; Background 2. Background --- CIDR CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) has considerably reduced routing table size growth through (a) aggregation of IP addresses into IP address prefixes, and (b) an address allocation policy that creates opportunities for aggregation RFC1518. In this section the concepts of prefixes and aggregation are explained. Then we will examine the benefits CIDR has to offer, as well as its limitations. 2.1. Prefixes An (IP address) prefix represents a range of IP addresses, and consists of an IP address part addr and a prefix length part p. A prefix is usually written as addr / p. The p indicates the leftmost contiguous significant bits within addr RFC1518. The IP address range denoted by a prefix addr/p are those IP addresses whose leftmost p bits equal the corresponding bits in addr. For example, the prefix 192.24.0.0/13 (IP address 192.24.0.0 and prefix length 13 bits) corresponds to the IP address range from 192.24.0.0 to 192.31.255.255. When two prefixes have the same IP address part, but differ in their prefix length part, the prefix with the longer prefix length is said to be more specific, and the prefix with the shorter prefix length is said to be less specific. For example, prefix 192.24.0.0/21 is more specific than prefix 192.24.0.0/13. The IP address range of a prefix is a subset of the IP address range of any less specific prefix. 2.2. Aggregation and CIDR Benefits CIDR allows a router to aggregate (summarise) a number of IP addresses and IP prefixes into a single IP prefix, and to announce to other routers only the resulting less specific prefix (aggregated prefix) instead of the more specific IP addresses and prefixes that it covers. To significantly benefit from the introduction of aggregation, CIDR also specifies an address allocation policy which creates the conditions in which aggregation can be performed. Figure&nbsp;1: Aggregation of prefixes An example of aggregation is shown in the above figure A provider AS (AS&nbsp;2) has been allocated the IP address block 192.24.0.0/13. The provider has two customer ASes (AS&nbsp;1 and AS&nbsp;3). In accordance with CIDR address allocation policy, the IP address blocks assigned to these customer ASes have been allocated out of the provider's address space: AS&nbsp;1 is allocated 192.24.0.0/21 and AS&nbsp;3 is allocated 192.24.8.0/21. AS&nbsp;1 and 3 announce prefixes for these address blocks to AS&nbsp;2. The announcements are indicated by the arrows. AS&nbsp;2 is attached to the backbone, and must make reachability announcements covering the address blocks of all three ASes. Due to the allocation of AS&nbsp;1 and AS&nbsp;3's address blocks out AS&nbsp;2's address space, AS&nbsp;2 is now able to aggregate the prefixes of AS&nbsp;1 and AS&nbsp;3 into its own prefix 192.24.0.0/13, and therefore only needs to announce this single prefix into the backbone. CIDR offers the following benefits through aggregation: The aggregating router is able to announce an aggregated prefix instead of the more specific IP addresses and prefixes that the aggregated prefix covers. This reduces the table size of any routers that learn of this announcement. The number and size of update messages (announcing or withdrawing IP addresses) are reduced. Not only do update messages carry just the aggregated prefixes instead of the more specific information, but CIDR can also prevent instability at the edge of the network to immediately propagate to the backbone Huston. The instability is `absorbed' at the point where the affected address space is aggregated. 2.3. More Specifics and the Limitations of CIDR CIDR allows a more specific prefix of some other prefix to be advertised. More specific prefixes override the routing policies associated with its less specific prefixes, as follows. A BGP router that receives advertisements of a more and a less specific prefix, will forward traffic along the AS path of the more specific prefix. A BGP router that has"},
{"url":"/project/atombr/200207-plan/1.html","title":"Atom-Based Routing; Introduction","description":"Atom-Based Routing; Introduction 1. Introduction Global routing in today's Internet is negotiated among individually operated sets of networks known as Autonomous Systems (AS). An AS is an entity that connects one or more networks to the Internet, and applies its own policies to the exchange of traffic. AS policy is used to control routing of traffic from and to certain networks via specific connections. These policies are articulated in router configuration languages and implemented by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) RFC1771. A basic BGP exchange consists of a message announcing (advertising) reachability of a single network via a certain router. The reachability information includes an AS path, which is a sequence of ASes. BGP assumes that: This path is taken by the reachability message. The advertised network can be reached via this path. A BGP table associates a network prefix identifier (prefix) with the AS path through which the network is considered reachable. This table is an important ingredient of the packet forwarding process by a BGP router. Reduction of the number of entries in BGP tables is typically seen as beneficial to infrastructural integrity. The number of entries in a table has bearing on both router memory and CPU cycles. The number and size of routing update messages (announcements and withdrawals of networks) tends to increase with the number of prefixes in the table. Not only are communication costs affected by this, but also the CPU resources needed to process the updates Huston. The project proposed in this document aims to significantly reduce growth of BGP table size and updates, in particular in the Internet backbone 1, through the use of BGP policy atoms CAIDA. The intent is to devise a routing protocol 2 (or adapt a routing protocol such as BGP) which makes use of atoms to achieve a protocol of lower compexity. The problem of BGP table size is not as severe outside the backbone. Routers that are not part of the backbone can rely on `default routes' which direct traffic for unrecognised destinations towards the backbone. Therefore they do not need to have a complete picture of the Internet. Routers in the backbone on the other hand cannot make use of such default routes, and need to have a picture of the Internet which covers every globally reachable IP address. We consider the routing protocol to be both the messages exchanged by the protocol and the basic algorithms of the routers that exchange these messages. Atoms could reduce current backbone BGP table sizes and growth by a factor of two, using the methodology of CAIDA2. However as mentioned later, there is a potential of a far greater return than a factor of two: around 22%. Next: 2. Background --- CIDR"},

Nieuwere informatie over NLnet vindt u elders op deze site) Korte geschiedenis NLnet NLnet is (met EUnet) omstreeks 1982 ontstaan uit de behoefte van een aantal wetenschappelijke en researchinstellingen om informatie-uitwisseling te realiseren met behulp van computerapparatuur. Aanvankelijk werd het computernetwerk op vrijwillige basis vormgegeven en gemanaged vanuit het Mathematisch Centrum (later CWI) op het WTCW-terrein in Amsterdam, zodat hier 'als vanzelf' een concentratie van netwerken en expertise ontstond. De op Nederland gerichte activiteiten van NLnet groeiden zodanig uit, dat dit in 1989 (op initiatief van de vereniging NLUUG) heeft geleid tot de oprichting van Stichting NLnet. De (statutaire) doelstelling van Stichting NLnet is 'het bevorderen van elektronische informatie-uitwisseling en al hetgeen daarmede verband houdt of daartoe bevorderlijk kan zijn '. Om de activiteiten die zich verder ontwikkelden tot de NLnet Internet Servicevoorziening in Nederland, verantwoord te kunnen laten groeien heeft de stichting in 1994 besloten tot het oprichten van een vennootschapsgroep NLnet (serviceverlening, inbel Internet facilitair beheer, Internet backbone beheer en Internet service ontwikkeling). In korte tijd na 1994 ontwikkelde de Internet markt zich enorm, zodanig dat er snel verschillende Internetserviceverleningbedrijven ontstonden en dat stimulering van Internetserviceverlening voor de stichting minder een doelstelling op zichzelf werd. Om een goede toekomst voor de NLnet vennootschapsgroep te bewerkstelligen werd omgezien naar een goede partner op internationaal niveau. Dit heeft in 1997 geleid tot de verkoop van de NLnet vennootschapsgroep aan UUNET (met als achterliggende eigenaar thans MCI WorldCom). Vanaf dat moment beschikte Stichting NLnet over voldoende middelen om zich opnieuw te kunnen concentreren op haar primaire doelstellingen. In 1998 is de ontwikkeling van dit aangepaste beleid in gang gezet. Algemeen beleid NLnet In de door NLnet te ondersteunen activiteiten zijn vijf categorie&euml;n te onderscheiden: stimulering van Internettechnologie door middel van subsidi&euml;ring en/of co-sponsoring van softwareontwikkelingsprojecten; stimulering van verspreiding en uitwisseling van kennis over Internettechnologie door middel van co-sponsoring en/of medeorganisatie van conferenties, workshops en wedstrijden; stimulering van Internetontwikkelingen door softwareontwikkeling in eigen beheer; stimulering van geavanceerd wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar netwerktechnologie, in samenwerking met universiteiten; stimulering van Internetkennisontwikkeling en kennisuitwisseling door het (co-)sponsoren van uitwisselingsprogramma's tussen universiteiten, hogescholen en onderzoeksinstituten. In alle vijf categorie&euml;n ligt het accent op stimulering; in stand houden van bestaande activiteiten is expliciet geen doelstelling van de stichting. Bij elk te ondersteunen of te ondernemen project worden de volgende basisvoorwaarden gehanteerd: het project leidt tot de ontwikkeling, verbetering of betere toepassing van netwerk (Internet) technologie ('Internet'-gerichtheid); alle resultaten van het project worden vrij ter beschikking gesteld van de gemeenschap ('Open Source'-gerichtheid); de resultaten van het project worden, indien mogelijk, gepresenteerd op een geschikte internationale conferentie ('publiek forum').

Introduction This annual report consists of the following sections: Introduction Activities in 2002 Official Information Financial Statements 1.1 The goal of LogReport Log files are often treated like a wasteful by-product of IT activity: they sit somewhere in a dark corner of a computer system and are only examined occasionally, usually in case of after-the-fact reactive problem solving. This is unfortunate. Log files contain the traces of computer activity, and by intelligently analyzing these traces one can learn a lot about the behavior of a system and its users. Log file analysis is both an essential and tedious part of system administration. It is essential because it's the best way of profiling the usage of the service installed on the network. It's tedious because programs generate a lot of data and tools to report on this data are unavailable or incomplete and when such tools exist, they are specific to one product, which means that you can't compare your Qmail and Exim mail servers. The Stichting LogReport Foundation detected this flaw in system administration and chose to serve a dual purpose: developing and maintaining Lire;, our Open Source reporting and analysis software, and serving as a nexus of documentation, ideas, and thought on the topic of log files and their potential applications. 2. Activities in 2002 2.1 Introduction We report on the activities of the LogReport team during 2002. The main task of this team is maintenance and development on Lire, LogReport's Free Software tool for performing an integrated analysis of all ones Internet and Intranet Services. Lire does this by automatically generating useful reports from raw logfiles from various services. Next to this work, the team has been doing promotional activities like writing articles, giving presentations, and maintaining our website. Furthermore, the team has been administering the LogReport server. Finally, the team has set up the LogReport.com entity. LogReport's server, called hibou.logreport.org, is hosted at VIA Networks in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The machine hosts the LogReport website http://logreport.org/, handles LogReport email, and hosts the 4 public mailinglists: &lt;commit@logreport.org&gt;, &lt;announcement@logreport.org&gt;, &lt;questions@logreport.org&gt;, and &lt;development@logreport.org&gt;. Furthermore, it hosts a CVS repository for version control of non-public documents and hibou's configuration data. The Lire code development is done using CVS on SourceForge.

Apart from this, the team met &quot;in real life&quot; at the LogReport Summit in May 2002. 2.2 People The following changes in the LogReport staff have occured during the year. As of January 1 2002, Plamen Bozukov left LogReport, and as of February 4, Jan Stap has left LogReport. Since November 1, 2002, Josh Koenig no longer works on a contract basis for LogReport. Since November 1, Joost van Baal has decreased his paid hours spent on LogReport work from 24 hours a week to 8 hours a week. This means the list of people, being paid by the LogReport Foundation for working on Lire, at the end of 2002 was: Joost van Baal (8 hours a week), Wessel Dankers (16 hours a week) and Francis J.

{"title":"ReX proposalDelft&nbsp;-&nbsp;BWRC","description":"ReX proposal Delft&nbsp;-&nbsp;BWRC Research EXchange Proposal Delft University of Technology and Berkeley Wireless Research Center (UC Berkeley) Henk Sips, March 2001 Overview We propose an exchange between Koen Langendoen, a postdoc in the Ubicom project at Delft University of Technology ( TU Delft ) and the Berkeley Wireless Research Center ( BWRC, UC Berkeley) headed by Jan Rabaey. Koen would work as a visiting researcher within the PicoRadio group for 3 months in summer 2001 (June\\xADAugust). Work concentrates on developing distributed localization algorithms for wireless sensor networks. Description of the sending institute The Parallel and Distributed Systems (PDS) group at Delft University of Technology is headed by Henk Sips. The PDS group participates in the multidisciplinary Ubiquitous Communications (UbiCom) research program aiming at specifying and developing wearable systems for mobile multimedia communications. At present, approximately 28 people, including faculty, grad students, and program\\xAD mers, are involved in Ubicom. Ubicom currently depends on a fixed infrastructure supporting mobile commu\\xAD nications (i.e. a network of base stations). We like to extend the domain of Ubicom to include ad\\xADhoc peer\\xADto\\xADpeer communications. This calls for the development of small radio systems that can be part of small light\\xADweight wearable systems. Description of the receiving institute The Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC) is a research unit operating as a part of the Electronics Research Laboratory in conjunction with the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Research activities are directed by the scientific directors (professors Robert Brodersen and Jan Rabaey). BWRC employs over 250 people itself and collaborates closely with researchers and technicians from leading wireless companies (Ericsson, Lucent, etc.). BWRC is organized as a number of specific research groups addressing different aspects of the design of wireless communication devices. The PicoRadio group, which is most relevant to Ubicom, explores issues related to design and implementation of a prototype PicoNode. This includes: exploring the application space for PicoNode, examining communication vs. processing cost tradeoffs and task partitioning related to issues such as resource assignment and power consumption, developing interconnect mechanisms between macro circuit blocks at the electrical level (timing and meaning of signals between blocks), and building a single\\xADchip implementation. Description of the postdoc Koen Langendoen is a postdoc with ample programming experience in wired and wireless communications; he has (co\\xAD)authored many papers in this area. Within the Ubicom project he works on the Quality of Service aspects of wireless communications, in particular, on the trade\\xADoff between performance (throughput, bit\\xADerror\\xADrate) and cost (power). He also supervises the construction of a pocket\\xADsized experimental platform based on a low\\xADpower StrongARM processor, which will be used to measure the behavior of power\\xADaware applications in a realistic setting. Koen is about to become a faculty member. He would like to extend his Ubicom activities to the challenging domain of wireless sensor networks, in which low\\xADpower becomes even more important and self\\xADconfigurability is a mandatory requirement. To realize his ambitions he has submitted a research proposal for the \"NWO's vernieuwingsimpuls\" (a Dutch program funding fundamental and innovative research). Research exchange plan The improvements in digital circuitry technology allow for the integration of sensors, processing, and wireless communication onto a single chip in the near future. The resulting wireless sensors will be small, cheap and employed in large\\xADscale networks for monitoring and control of the environment. Several well\\xADknown universities in the USA are working hard to","url":"/project/rex/200106-Delft-BWRC/200103-proposal.html"},

Mauro will work with Alexander Wolf on the Siena project for 9 months starting in July 2001. The work will primarily involve the development of novel wireless applications that leverage the Internet\\xADscale publish/subscribe middleware framework of Siena. Description of the Sending Institute The Computer Systems Group at University of L'Aquila has about 20 faculty, and about 20 PhD students and post\\xADdoctoral researchers. It currently offers a three\\xADyear and a five\\xADyear program in computer science, for a total of over 1000 students. Paola Inverardi coordinates the two programs. On the research side, the relevant areas are in the specification, design and development of complex distributed software systems, in programming languages, in algorithms for distributed and spatial data structures, and for distributed and mobile systems. The group headed by Paola Inverardi consists of approximately 10 people, including staff, researchers, and graduate students. The group is involved in a project on software architectures to coordinate distributed mobile components ( Saladin ). Description of the Receiving Institute The Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado has about 28 faculty, 600 undergraduate students, and 200 graduate students. The traditional areas of strength in the department are numerical and parallel computing, machine learning, systems, and software engineering. Growth areas targeted by the department for the future are pervasive and wireless computing, networking, and security. The group headed by Alexander Wolf consists of approximately 12 people, including faculty, staff, and graduate students. The group is focused on the problems of engineering large, complex software systems. Recent projects are in the areas of configuration management, software architecture, middleware, security, and networking. Description of the Student Mauro Caporuscio is currently a master's student in the Computer Systems group. He has begun work on his thesis, which is a project to investigate the suitability of Siena to support the design of mobile applications. Mauro has followed the five\\xADyear program in Computer Science curricula, which contains around 30 units in computer science (1 unit = 45 hours classes), 8 to 10 units in mathematics, four units in physics. Units in computer science include courses on programming, operating systems, computer networks, distributed systems, software engineering. He has done a considerable amount of practical work in the form of various assignments, most of which comprise four to six weeks of full\\xADtime design and implementation. In fact, almost all his courses in the last three years have contained practical work. He has shown to be a strong and practical student, interested in exploring and using new technologies. Research Exchange Plan Recently there has been a growing interest in the design of mobile applications for cellular phones. Paola Inverardi's group is currently experimenting with the use of the WAP technology in a variety of application domains. A key issue facing these applications is how to achieve a good integration between the wireless and internet networks in terms of software architectural paradigms. For example, the common client/server architecture, widely used in internet\\xADbased e\\xADcommerce applications, is not suitable for a mobile environment. In the client/server model most of the application logic is usually relegated to the client, which in a mobile context is supported by a small, limited device such as a cellular phone, and cannot count on a reliable network connection to transfer part of its"},

Introduction NLnet Labs was founded in 1999 by Stichting NLnet to develop, implement, evaluate and promote new protocols and applications for the Internet. The NLnet Labs offices are located in the Amsterdam Science Park (ASP) where traditionally most Internet development in The Netherlands has taken place. The ASP is still very important for the Internet, as it is the location of the Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX), in which vicinity many Internet companies can be found. 2. Activities of Stichting NLnet Labs in 2001 The two areas in which NLnet Labs' staff has invested time and resources are projects and collaboration with other organisations. The 3 elements: staff, projects and collaboration are addressed in this section. 2.1 Staff The goal of NLnet Labs is to contribute knowledge to the Internet. This can be achieved by software development, but also by educating people to develop software elsewhere. The budget of NLnet labs is based on long term (15 years) development with up to six people. The original goal to increase the number of developers to 4 or 5 (including the director) by the end of 2001, was not reached. The skills needed to work at NLnet Labs are manifold, the choice of candidates was not: the choice was to lower our standards, up the salaries, or postpone hiring for better times. The last option was chosen. The 4 developers within NLnet Labs in 2001: Alexis Yushin (as of April), Miek Gieben, Stephan Jager, and Ted Lindgreen (director) worked on the projects described in the next section. 2.2 Projects The three projects on which NLnet Labs focussed are: DNSSEC, IPv6 and NSD. 2.2.1 DNSSEC The DNSSEC project started in 2000 with an investigation of the scaling issues involved in deploying DNSSEC for large domains. In 2001 the following aspects were addressed: 2.2.1.1 Parent-child communication NLnet Labs set up an experiment to implement a secure shadow tree of .nl, called .nl.nl. From this experiment we learned that real scaling problems exist with the current proposal for a standard (RFC 2535) with respect to implementing secure parent-child communication procedures. NLnet Labs proposed an alternative way to deal with the parent-child relation in a draft-RFC (officially: Internet-Draft). Although we recognized that a major change to the standard was more appropriate, we intentionally proposed the smallest possible change in order to not scare people off. At first, the draft-RFC encountered a lot of scepsis (&quot;It is changing the fundamentals of DNS&quot;), but by the next IETF meeting the problem pointed out by NLnet Labs was broadly recognized. The chair of the dns-ext working group proposed a bolder change, involving the introduction of a new record-type: &quot;DS&quot;. Because this change is fundamentally a better one than our lightweight proposal, NLnet Labs dropped its draft-RFC in favour of the DS-proposal. In the mean time, the general interest in DNSSEC has grown even more, and NLnet Labs is proud that its work has contributed to move DNSSEC out of its earlier deadlock. 2.2.1.2 The sigchase addition to BIND-9 In BIND-8 it was possible to check signatures and chase keys with the &quot;host -s&quot; command. This is a powerful tool for debugging. However, because of a bug in the BIND-8 code the results are sometimes incorrect. Such a tool is not included in BIND-9, and developers at Nominum have led us to believe that they are not planning on adding such a tool. NLnet Labs, however, believes that such a tool is absolutely necessary. NLnet Labs has therefore written an extension to BIND-9 with the same functionality as in BIND-8. The main difference is that this code produces correct results in all cases. In addition, the signature checking code is also available in the &quot;dig&quot; tool with"},
{"title":"Mail::Box projectplan","description":"Mail::Box projectplan Mark A.C.J. Overmeer, MARKOV Solutions De Mail::Box module is een software pakket dat is (en wordt) ontwikkeld om de afhandeling van e-mail via Perl erg makkelijk en fool-proof te maken. De programmeertaal Perl wordt veel gebruikt door netwerk- en systeembeheerders die hun taken willen automatiseren. De Mail::Box voor Perl is te gebruiken voor allerlei e-mail gerelateerde handelingen: het cree&euml;ren van automatische replys op berichten bestemd voor werknemers die het bedrijf hebben verlaten; het intelligent doorsturen van e-mail voor gebruikers naar de systemen waarop zij hun e-mail lezen; het filteren van spam en detecteren of strippen van e-mail virussen; en het loggen en monitoren van e-mail gebruik. Mail::Box is ook te gebruiken voor procmail-achtige toepassingen van gewone gebruikers en mail-applicatie ontwikkelaars. De eerste Mail User Agent (MUA, e-mail lees en maak toepassing) gebaseerd op Mail::Box is ook in ontwikkeling. De meeste e-mail gerelateerde modules voor Perl zijn niet geschikt voor de huidige vorm van e-mail berichten; zij kunnen nauwelijks tot niet overweg met attachments, verschillende mime-types en coderingen. Vaak zijn deze modules al erg oud en in ouderwets Perl geschreven. Vandaar dat Mail::Box een nuttige aanvulling is. Huidige toestand van Mail::Box Mail::Box is momenteel al een krachtig pakket, dat de applicatie programmeur veel mogelijkheden biedt, waaronder behandeling van Mbox, MH en Maildir folder-formaten. De verschillen in opslag worden voor de gebruiker verborgen. Daarnaast zijn uitbreidingen aangebracht om bestaande verschillen op te heffen, zoals sub-folder simulatie voor Mbox en Maildir; krachtige functies voor het maken van een reply, forward of bounce van een message; verscheidene manieren om correcte messages op te bouwen; ondersteuning voor message-threads -- het verzamelen van gerelateerde berichten. Thread relaties zijn ook beschikbaar voor folder-types waar de bestaande MUA dat normaliter niet verzorgen om redenen van performance. Deze performance bezwaren zijn in Mail::Box grotendeels opgeheven door een consequent lazy omgaan met de data: werk wordt zo veel mogelijk uitsteld; uitgebreide documentatie: meer dan 30 duizend regels documentatie in de manual-pages en een paper voor de German Perlworkshop 2002 (Engelstalig). Daarnaast maken een klein aantal voorbeeldscripts en enkele eenvoudige applicatie-programma's onderdeel uit van de module. Mail::Box is gebouwd op de kennis die ligt opgeslagen in de verouderde Perl modules en eigen gebruikerservaring. Ontwikkelingen vinden plaats naar gelang de beschikbare vrije tijd en bevliegingen van de auteur. De code is volledig object-geori&euml;nteerd opgezet, en goed uitbreidbaar. Versie 2.011 definieert 95 objecten en ruim 2400 regressie-tests. Wensen Hoewel Mail::Box al een van de grotere Perl modules is, is deze nog verre van af. De verbeteringen dienen op twee fronten plaats te vinden: kwaliteitsverbetering, en uitbreiding van functionaliteit. Kwaliteitsverbetering Met betrekking tot de kwaliteitsverbetering staan de volgende punten op de wensenlijst: de modules moeten worden gecheckt tegen de RFCs, De code is nu gebaseerd op kennis uit de oude modules, gebruikerservaring van de auteur en klachten van gebruikers. Dat is een redelijke, maar zeker niet ideale basis voor goede software; de documentatie dient uitgebreid en gecorrigeerd te worden, Er is al veel documentatie geschreven tijdens de ontwikkeling van de module tot diens huidige staat. Echter, ondertussen zijn ook flink veel verbetering doorgevoerd die niet op alle plekken in de documentatie zijn doorgedrongen. Alle tekst moet nog eens door de molen; betere ondersteuning op meerdere platformen, module werkt onder UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X en Windows. Bij de laatste twee zijn er nog wel enkele beperkingen. Onder andere het versturen van e-mail vanuit eigen applicaties is bij Windows niet makkelijk te realiseren.

{"title":"Funding of Hackathon 2003","description":"Funding of Hackathon 2003 Situation of the OpenBSD Project The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. The project emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography. All source code is released under a BSD license and much care is put into verifying that the integrated source code does not violate any form of license or patent to ensure that the resulting releases are free for anybody to use and modify for ANY PURPOSE, with no restrictions. The goal is to produce software that is robust and secure, and the developers encourage companies to use whichever pieces they want to. In the past, OpenBSD has been on the forefront to integrate cryptographic subsystems. This means that IPsec, IPv6, SSL, key engines, Kerberos, free-AFS and other forms of strong crypto or crypto-using systems have been part of the base system. OpenSSH is a well known OpenBSD subsystem that has been successfully ported from OpenBSD to various Unices, free (Linux) and non-free (Solaris, OS&nbsp;X) and various others (like HP ProCurve switches). OpenBSD is developed and released from Canada and due to Canadian law it is legal to export crypto to the world. There is currently much interest in porting the firewalling infrastructure (known as PF, Packet Filter) to other systems like FreeBSD. Much development is put into implementing new and innovating mechanisms to improve security, like Systrace, an utility to monitors and control an application's access to the system by enforcing access policies for system calls and the ProPolice stack protection technology, a buffer overflow protection integrated into the system compiler. Pioneering these techniques results in publications and presentations at various big conferences to raise awareness about these issues. Hackathon funding problems OpenBSD is developed by volunteers. The project funds development and releases by selling CDs and T-shirts, as well as receiving donations. Organizations like Usenix and individuals donate and thus ensure that OpenBSD will continue to exist, and will remain free for everyone to use and reuse as they see fit. The POSSE program (Portable Open Source Security Elements) in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania provided resources for core developers of the OpenBSD, OpenSSH and OpenSSL projects through a DARPA grant in the past. This provided funding for a yearly meeting of most OpenBSD and OpenSSH developers in Calgary, an event known as Hackathon. Over 60 developers meet in a hotel where a conference room is equipped with the necessary hardware and network infrastructure to allow them to brainstorm, design and implement new concepts. The Hackathon is an essential event for people to meet and talk about what direction the next OpenBSD release will take. Very often, rough implementations are started at the Hackathon and later over a period of many months worked out and finished. Companies sometimes make new (prototype) hardware available (like UltraSparc&nbsp;III machines and AMD Hammer pre-release machines) to get premium access to OpenBSD developers. This year [2003], the event is scheduled to take place in Calgary (Canada), May 10&nbsp;-&nbsp;18th. But in April DARPA suddenly and unexpectedly canceled funding for OpenBSD R&amp;D and the hotel for the upcoming Hackathon, thus providing a huge cash flow problem. Many developers have long bought non-refundable plane tickets and made travel arrangements to attend the event. More information about this you can find in many press articles. Currently, people from various countries have committed themselves to come: Sweden, Netherlands, USA, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, France, Spain, and Belgium. Nevertheless the Hackathon will happen as scheduled, and the OpenBSD project will continue to operate based on donations from the user community and other sources who continue to support the project.

The meeting took place at the Annahoeve, which is a country house near Zundert in the very South of the Netherlands. Developers from all across Europe -representing all the key KDE PIM applications- gathered for coding work. Usability experts, specialized in making computer software more user friendly, stepped in as well. The event started on Friday morning with several presentations from the sponsors and key developers, with related topics. After the lunch the meeting itself took off. From that afternoon until Sunday evening the developers were able to fix several bugs and improve the user friendliness in a couple of places. They discussed several key topics. During the final session of the meeting, the upcoming work was discussed. The results of that will slowly become visible over the weeks. Looking back at the event, several very important results were made. Most notably, development decisions where made, which works best when the involved people meet in person. One of the key factors to the success of the meeting has certainly been the excellent location. The quiet area, away from crowded city streets, the nice weather and the luxury of everything being taken care of (including high-quality catering) helps a lot in focusing on the issues at hand and stimulating healthy discussions.

Either approach has its advantages: allocated atoms are conceptually more easily established (not requiring computation), whereas computed atoms are likely to be more effective, in that they are computed based on the similarity of prefixes as observed by the routers. For instance, computed atoms allow prefixes originated by different ASes to be part of the same atom (such as atom A3 in Figures&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3). In addition, computed atoms allow for greater transparency, since non-backbone routers are not involved in any way (Section&nbsp; 5 ). However Huston's definition of atoms provides an interesting alternative that may be of use to us. In particular we can use the techniques in Sections&nbsp; 5.1 and 5.2 and apply them to allocated rather than computed atoms. So it should be possible to use allocated atoms as a `fallback' should it turn out that computed atoms are too expensive or unscalable. To elaborate a little further on allocated atoms: rather than computing atoms in the backbone of the Internet, ASes throughout the Internet can be allocated atom ids (e.g. by IANA). ASes then announce and withdraw atom ids rather than prefixes in routing update messages. To propagate the mapping between atom ids and prefixes, BGP update messages that include a BGP community attribute RFC1997 can be used. The BGP community attribute contains the atom id, which applies to the prefixes carried by the update message. Such an approach removes the burden of atom computation from backbone routers. On the other hand, it is more drastic in that it requires all ASes in the Internet to cooperate. 7.2. Frank Kastenholz's Aggregates In Kastenholz Frank Kastenholz introduces a new kind of aggregate. Kastenholz's aggregates are a significantly different concept from atoms. However, Frank Kastenholz is addressing similar issues. Also, like us, Kastenholz separates aggregate ids from aggregate contents, and performs routing computations on aggregate ids instead of prefixes. However, Kastenholz's approach does not remove knowledge of prefixes from any routers. In contrast, we remove prefixes from a subset of routers (the transit routers in Section&nbsp; 5.1 ), or at least from the forwarding tables (Section&nbsp; 5.2 ). We also believe that our approach is somewhat less disruptive than Kastenholz's: we point to ways in which atoms can be applied effectively within the backbone (or part of the backbone) transparently (Sections&nbsp; 5.1 and 5.2 ).

{"title":"Atom-Based Routing; Policy Atoms","url":"/project/atombr/200207-plan/3.html","description":"Atom-Based Routing; Policy Atoms 3. Policy Atoms In CAIDA the notion of `policy atoms' was introduced as a means to analyse the complexity of routing tables. By analysing a number of backbone routers the authors found that the use of policy atoms could potentially reduce the size of a complete backbone BGP table by a factor of two, while preservering all globally visible routing policies CAIDA2. In addition, they found that the number of atoms properly scales with the Internet's growth. 3.1. Definition of Policy Atoms An atom is defined relative to a system of BGP routers. For example, it may be defined relative to the Internet backbone routers or (in the extreme) to all BGP routers in the Internet. Each atom consists of prefixes that are treated equivalently by the chosen system of BGP routers. For example in Figure&nbsp;2 the prefixes 192.24.0.0/13 and 192.24.0.0/22 are treated equivalently by the backbone routers and are therefore part of the same atom (relative to the backbone). In CAIDA, an atom is defined as follows. Two prefixes are said to be path equivalent if no BGP router can be found among the considered BGP routers that sees them with different AS paths. An equivalence class of this relation is called a (BGP policy) atom. It follows from this definition that prefixes in the same atom share a set of AS paths. In this proposal we use a slightly modify definition, as follows 3 In determining path equivalence of two prefixes, we ignore the part of a prefix's AS path that falls outside the system of BGP routers. From this definition, it follows that prefixes in the same atom share a set of truncated AS paths, where each AS path is truncated to exclude the part that falls outside the system. Note that under this modified definition a smaller number of atoms will result. This definition corresponds more closely to the definition of crown atoms in CAIDA than to regular (non-crown) atoms. We call the system of BGP routers relative to which an atom is defined the scope of the atom. Algorithmically, atoms may be constructed as follows: Select a system of BGP routers to be considered (as mentioned above). This becomes the scope of the atoms. Select the set of prefixes to be considered. For example, the prefixes common to all BGP routers in the chosen system might be selected CAIDA. Another possible selection is the set of prefixes each of which is known by at least one BGP router in the chosen system. With each prefix associate a set of AS paths between the BGP routers. Truncate each AS path in the set by removing the part that falls outside the chosen system. For each set of truncated AS paths, find all prefixes that share this set of paths. The following example derives atoms from the prefixes shown in Figure&nbsp;2 using the algorithm. The system of BGP routers considered (and therefore the scope of these atoms) consists of the backbone routers that appear in Figure&nbsp;2; the prefixes considered are all those shown in Figure&nbsp;2. The atoms that can then be derived are shown in Figure&nbsp;3 Note that although the full AS paths of e.g. 192.24.0.0/13 and 192.24.0.0/22 are different (since the former is originated by AS&nbsp;2 and the latter by AS&nbsp;1), the parts of the AS paths which fall within the backbone, i.e. the truncated AS paths, are the same. Therefore they are in the same atom. Figure&nbsp;3: Atoms derived from Figure&nbsp;2 Note that the size of the atoms which result from the above definition depends in part on the system of routers considered: the fewer routers are considered the larger the atom size will tend to be. In addition the atom size also depends on the selection of prefixes considered. Next: 4. Atom-Based Routing"},

{"description":"ReX Proposal VU&nbsp;-&nbsp;CAIDA Research Exchange Proposal Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam and CAIDA UC San Diego Maarten van Steen, June 2000 Overview We propose an exchange between Wilfred Dittmer, a master's student and future scientific programmer in the Computer Systems Group at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, and CAIDA in San Diego. Wilfred would work with KC Claffy on the Skitter project for 6 months starting in September 2000. Work concentrates on enhancing and developing tools for measuring Internet traffic in order to obtain better insight in the physical orgainzation of the network. Description of the Sending Institute The Computer Systems Group at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is headed by Andrew Tanenbaum. The group is working on wide-area distributed systems in the Globe project. They are now in a phase in which experiments across the Internet can be set up. At present, approximately 13 people, including staff, researchers, grad students, and programmers, are involved in Globe. The Computer Systems group is actively cooperating with the Intelligent Interactive Distributed Systems group headed by Frances Brazier. The main field of cooperation currently lies in designing a worldwide scalable architecture for supporting agent-based application development. We aim to integrate this agent architecture and Globe into a single system. Description of the Receiving Institute The Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) is a collaborative undertaking among different organizations aimed at promoting greater cooperation in the engineering and maintenance of the Internet. One of the goals of CAIDA that is particularly relevant for this proposal, is creating Internet traffic metrics, and actually measuring various performance issues related to the Internet. CAIDA is located at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), which is an extension of the University of California at San Diego (UCSD). It was founded by dr KC Claffy. Description of the Student Wilfred Dittmer is currently a master's student in the Computer Systems group. He is finishing his thesis on using the Globe wide-area location service for building a secure, scalable Instant Messaging service. The main distinction with existing messaging services, is the inherently distributed and scalable nature of the location database, as well as facilities for secure tracking and communication of peers. Wilfred has followed the Computer Systems track of courses, which includes courses in operating systems, computer networks, parallel programming, and distributed systems. He has done a considerable amount of practical work in the form of various assignments, most of which comprise 3-6 weeks fulltime design and implementation. He has shown to be a strong and practical student, aimed at making something that is useful for others. We have offered Wilfred a job as a scientific programmer in the Globe project. His task will be to do detailed design and implementation of various Globe components, starting with work in the field of security. Research Exchange Plan Wilfred is interested in designing and implementing components for complex distributed systems. One of his drives is develop programs that are actually used by end users, and not to just build programs for the mere fun of programming. This aspect also brings us to one of the problems in wide-area research: to make distributed systems that are actually uselful, it is necessary to do various experiments to see how components actually behave. To that end, having access to wide-area data, and being able to analyze data by means of appropriate tools is a must. Such data and tools are currently missing in the Computer Systems group. In addition, equally leveling the expertise at CAIDA concerning Internet metrics and measurements, is not practically feasible. In other words, the work and expertise at CAIDA supplements that present in our own group.

{"description":"ReX Cambridge-KUB Update from the Field A report on the ReX exchange program Tilburg University, The Netherlands and the Natural Language and Information Processing (NLIP) Group at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK. By Sabine Buchholz (buchholz@kub.nl) As not all readers of ;login: might be familiar with the research field of Computational Linguistics which forms the scientific background of this report about my four\\xADmonths exchange stay at Cambridge University, UK, I will start by introducing some of the most important concepts. Computational Linguistics studies the combination of computers and natural, i.e. human, languages. It aims at developing and implementing models of how natural languages can be processed. Applications include text\\xADto\\xADspeech, machine translation, question answering and natural language interfaces. A common subtask in many applications is parsing: determining the syntactic structure of a sentence. Although to a certain extent parsing can be done on the basis of knowledge about the part\\xADof\\xADspeech (like verb, noun, preposition) of words, it is widely acknowledged that information about specific words (lexical knowledge), is advantageous. One of the most important pieces of lexical information is subcat(egorization), especially of verbs. This tells us for example that a verb like \"give\" preferably takes two complements (the ditransitive frame): \"to give somebody something\", whereas \"invent\" takes one complement (transitive): \"to invent something\" and \"sleep\" takes none (intransitive): \"to sleep\" but not \"to sleep something\". This information helps the parser in disambiguating sentences that would otherwise be ambiguous, like \"She gave/invented Tim water.\" As parsers should be applicable to all kinds of texts, from all domains (for example for applications on the internet), and extensive subcategorization information is not readily available for all verbs, it can best be acquired automatically. It is this subcat acquisition problem that I worked on during my exchange to Cambridge. Ted Briscoe is a reader in Computational Linguistics in the Natural Language and Information Processing Group (NLIP) group at Cambridge University. He had previously developed an automatic subcat acquisition system that works by parsing large amounts of texts (parsing based on part\\xADof\\xADspeech information only), recording the frequency with which each frame occurs with each verb and filtering out combinations that did not occur sufficiently frequently (and are thus probably due to parser errors). Those verb\\xADframe combinations that pass the filter, together with their associated frequencies (converted to probabilities) can subsequently be used for better probabilistic parsing. To improve the performance of this last filtering step, PhD student Anna Korhonen developed a method for smoothing the acquired frequency distributions of new verbs by backing\\xADoff to semantically related known verbs, and for filtering based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the resulting frequencies. As her method presupposes knowledge about semantic classes of verbs which is not easily available for all verbs, my task for the project was to explore alternative filtering approaches using machine learning. I was a fourth\\xADyear PhD student in Tilburg, The Netherlands. As part of my research is on finding grammatical relations between verbs and their complements, which is related to parsing and subcat acquisition, I already knew several of Ted's and Anna's publications on the subject when Ted asked my supervisor Walter Daelemans whether one of Walter's students would be interested in the project. Walter had developed a machine learning algorithm called Memory\\xADBased Learning (based on the k\\xADNearest Neighbor algorithm) which I also use for my thesis research, so I had the necessary background for the project and also liked the idea to spend some time in another foreign country.

{"description":"Research Exchange Proposal UC Research Exchange Proposal between University of Colorado and the Computer Systems Group at the Vrije University in Amsterdam Evi Nemeth, February 2000 Overview We propose an exchange between Dan Crawl, a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado and the Computer Systems Group headed by Andy Tanenbaum at the Vrije University in Amsterdam. Dan would work with Andy and Maarten van Steen on their Globe Research project for 9 months beginning January, 2000 in particular on the location service portion of Globe. Description of the Sending Institute The Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado has about 25 faculty, 600 undergraduates, and 150 graduate students. The areas of strength in the department are numerical and parallel computing, artificial intelligence, and theory. The department is weaker in systems and has been actively trying to hire in the broad areas of software and systems for two years. We have so far been unsuccessful at hiring faculty in networks and distributed systems; the job market in the US for PhD faculty candidates is fierce right now. Candidates get \"stolen\" by companies like Microsoft, sometimes even before they graduate. Description of the Receiving Institute The Computer Systems Group at the Vrije University is world reknown. The Globe project is addressing the very real problem of the web growing exponentially and not being designed with solid computer science expertise to scale accordingly. It is building on the web's universal interface and good usability features, but redesigning the underlying engine to support distributed shared objects that might be web pages or email messages or news articles. The Vrije University also has strengths in artificial intelligence, theory, and is building a software engineering group. Description of the Student Dan Crawl first came to the Computer Science Department while in high school, at first to our programming contests and later to work in our system administration support group. Boulder high schools allow students to take University classes and count them for both high school and college. Dan choose to come to the University of Colorado in part because of the classes in the CS program that he had already taken. He was part of our 1998 programming team that won the ACM mountain regional contest (against 65 other teams) and participated in the ACM Internationals in Eindhoven. He is a strong student, a good programmer and problem solver, and a finisher. He has a good feel for evaluating a problem, devising a solution and getting it done. He is in his first year of graduate school and wants to work in systems and networks. Research Exchange Plan Dan wants to do systems research for his Phd thesis, but the faculty in systems at Colorado lean to the architecture side (Dirk Grunwald), groupware (Skip Ellis) or modeling (Gary Nutt). No one is building systems that span the areas of systems and networks. Mike Schwartz was in this area, but left to help found @Home. The Computer Systems Group at VU is very strong in this area. and would in effect supplement the faculty at Colorado for Dan. Dirk Grunwald whose primary research area is computer architecture, but who has also done work in performance analysis and distributed shared memory systems, would visit VU once during Dan's internship to exchange research ideas with the Computer Systems Group. Evi Nemeth who is currently working in network traffic analysis will be in the Netherlands for the SANE conference in May and will also visit the group and check up on Dan's progress. It is our hope that Dan can both be useful member of the team building the Globe system and also get ideas for his research that he can bring home and continue after the internship is over. If he is truly useful to the project then he could perhaps come back another summer or for a longer time when he is doing his dissertation research later in his degree","url":"/project/rex/200002-VU-UC/200002-proposal.html","title":"Research Exchange Proposal UC"},
{"description":"OpenBSD routing mini hackathon The OpenBSD project produces a free, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. OpenBSD is developed by volunteers. To accelerate the development process mini hackathons are organised for a specific task, with just specific people. Over the last few years the OpenBSD project has created two more sub-projects: OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD -- two secure and efficient routing daemons for the BGP and OSPF protocol. Major network infrastructure providers most notably the internet exchanges TIX, DeCIX and AMS-IX are switching to or evaluating OpenBGPD as a replacement for their route-servers. Many ISPs are using OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD in their core network and are impressed by the performance and stability. This mini hackathon will concentrate on better routing support. The capabilities of the routing daemons are more and more limited by the kernel support. The BSD network stack is still mostly based on 4.4BSD and lacks some important features. Two missing features are policy and multi-path routing. Additionally the lack of in-kernel support for the administrative distance of routes makes the integration of routing daemons unnecessary hard. The challange is to integrate these features into the kernel without breaking existing behaviour. This mini hackathon allows us to do research at large which is almost impossible to do without such a meeting. The core network developer from FreeBSD will attend the mini-hackathon as well. Instead of developing two incompatible interface the projects will join forces and create something for the next decade.","title":"OpenBSD routing mini hackathon","url":"/project/hackathons/2006openbgpd/20060614-plan.html"},

Theoretical studies of relevant cryptographic properties of the the Boolean function and the connection polynomials of the LFSR. Fast software implementation of the LFSR in software. Evaluating the scheme against existing and proposed attack. Achieved So far: We have developed a very fast software stream cipher scheme based on the well-known nonlinear combiner model. A detailed report [1] on these scheme is attached here. We have earlier sent a draft report of this scheme to you. The present version is a modi ed one. We have discussed the detailed design procedure, security of the scheme against most of the relevant existing attacks. A fast implementation technique of the LFSRs and the Boolean function has been developed in this work. Th scheme is faster than any of the existing software stream cipher scheme in LINUX and SUN platform (19-71 Gbps). Various properties of the connection polynomialsn of LFSRs are studied in the paper [2]. This paper has been presented in SAC 2002. The cryptographic properties of the Boolean function has been discussed in [3]. Here an Important construction technique of resilient Boolean function have been described. The paper is to be presented in INDOCRYPT 2002. To be done: The security of the proposed scheme is to be studied in the light of some very recently proposed attacks on similar scheme. We also need to study the performance of the proposed scheme in various platforms. Lastly we intend to explore the possibility of using this scheme in embedded software for secure communication over desktop PCs. We also plan to develop a fast software stream cipher system based on SNOW and AES. Preliminary discussion has been completed between Prof. Johansson and Prof. Roy.

{"description":"Meeting of OpenSync In the weekend of the 13th through 15th of January 2006, several open source developers traveled to The Netherlands to work together on the new syncing framework OpenSync. This framework is being created to solve some of the problems one currently runs into when synchronizing mobile devices on operating systems like Linux. OpenSync is a cross platform and desktop agnostic syncing solution for mobile devices and desktops. OpenSync uses plug-ins for syncing different kinds of devices, which can be easily plugged in the framework. The developers worked throughout the weekend on the next release of OpenSync, which is expected to be part of new versions of Linux desktop distributions everywhere. Sponsorship by the Stichting NLnet and IBM Netherlands made it possible for these open source developers to travel to The Netherlands to collaborate face to face on the OpenSync project. Also, the developers were able to explain to interested parties what they expect this syncing framework is capable of now, and what they hope to achieve in the near future.

{"description":"KDE MultiMedia Meeting [May 26-28, 2006] This international KDE developer meeting about multimedia will take place in the Annahoeve in the Netherlands. Its aim will be to make the pervasive role of multimedia less of a burden to manage for users and developers. People experience multimedia every day. Sound and animation are as common as written text. With the advent of more powerful desktop computers, users want to be able to have the same experience while working at their computer as in real life. They want to play and organize their favorite music, watch a movie, and burn their own CDs and DVDs without having to put great effort into getting the respective applications to work. A professional desktop environment should aim to offer these by default, with good support for the majority of possible hardware configurations, in order to gain a solid user base. What plans does the multimedia project have? With the new major KDE release, KDE 4, coming up, the multimedia backend will be largely rewritten. A multimedia system for KDE is being developed which is to solve a great deal of the problems in the existing, older multimedia parts. This new system will aim for better integration of media frameworks into KDE without locking out other multimedia applications. It will enable developers to easily add multimedia capabilities to their applications, without having to know nor care about the underlying platform. Why do we organize a meeting? For the KDE project it is important that developers enjoy their work. With a few exceptions, all developers contribute to KDE in their spare time without being paid for it. In 2005, a KDE-PIM event was organised by KDE Netherlands for contributors to the PIM (Personal Information Management) module, which was under especially heavy development at that time. A group of developers gathered to discuss ideas, code, and more. The environment, ambiance, and services provided by the Annahoeve made sure that the attendees could focus on the things they came for: discussing, thinking, and creating. Meeting face to face and working together enabled them to lay the groundwork for new innovations. Important improvements to the usability of the PIM applications, notably KMail, the email client have been made. The results of last year's meeting proved that it is really worthwhile to organize such a (short) event. Therefore, in 2006, another event is planned, again at the Annahoeve, this time for the multimedia part of KDE. Multimedia developers worldwide are expected to come together at the end of May and experience the same productivity boost as the PIM developers had in 2005. With a well-organised meeting and the excellent results of last year's meeting still in our mind, we are confident that the KDE MultiMedia Meeting will have a significant impact on multimedia development inside, but also outside, the KDE project. Examples for multimedia applications in KDE Two of the best known multimedia applications in KDE are: amaroK, a full-featured music player. Amongst its features are playlist support, the possibility to download lyrics for songs, streaming media, custom-styled interfaces through the use of CSS, full AudioScrobbler support, and high scriptability through KDE's DCOP platform. AmaroK as a media player stands out due to its feature-rich interface, and its modern way of dealing with multimedia content, even among closed source competitors. K3B, a CD burning application.

{"description":"Funding Request KDE development KDE is a Worldwide, international project. People from around the World contribute to the development of this desktop environment which can be used on Linux and other Unixes. The desktop is the graphical user interface plus a large set of commonly used applications, one of which is the personal information manager ( PIM ) named Kontact: the agenda and e-mail applications of KDE. KDE developers are organized per continent and sometimes per country. Next to the formal continent representatives who watch over the regional concerns, smaller local groups have shaped in recent years. Those groups promote the local use and development of KDE, primarily by creating localization; adapting the interface to language, currency, and character-set needs. The strength of the international cooperation in KDE is best shown from the number of languages supported: already 89 (2005) Some of those local groups, like in France, Germany, the UK, and The Netherlands go a little further, trying to make the larger public aware of KDE. KDE-NL (The Netherlands) is a SIG (Special Interest Group) of the NLUUG (the Dutch Unix Users Group) with the following objectives: localizing the KDE desktop to improve the usability in the Dutch and Flemish languages. promoting the free KDE as valuable alternative for commercial desktop /application combinations. demonstrating that KDE on Linux or other Unix platforms provide a good way to reduce costs for companies which like to limit their ICT budgets. support the (software) development, both inside and outside the language and country boundaries. KDEPIM-NL meeting In 2005, the KDE-NL group organizes a meeting of international KDE developers, as example of the latter objective. The target is to improve KDE's PIM application: the agenda and e-mail application. The KDEPIM-NL meeting 2005 takes place from May 27 till 29. Amongst others, hackers from Germany, Sweden, Chili, and England are expected to join in. Some of them develop for hobby, and other for profession. They will work intensively together to improve the PIM application, to produce the best possible program. On the agenda of the event are a dozen of improvements. For instance, the integration of a conferencing application, the creation of an MS Exchange plug-in, and the syncing framework named 'Kitchensync'.

{"description":"Final Report Exchange VU-CAIDA Partipants Before I go onto the summary, I first would like to thank the people that made the exchange between the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and caida (cooperative association for internet data analyses, San Diego, USA) possible. I would like to thank kc claffy, Evi Nemeth, Frances Brazier and Maarten van Steen for their efforts to allow me to do this exchange and Rex (USENIX/NLnet endeavour) for providing everything else needed for the exchange. CAIDA Caida is a organization that by means of their skitter tool are actively probing the Internet in order to analyze topology and performance. Skitter measures forward IP paths by recording each hop to many destinations. Using ICMP echo requests, skitter also collects Round Trip Time (RTT) to those destinations. The data collected provides indications of low-frequency persistent routing changes and correlations between RTT and time of day may reveal a change in either forward or reverse path routing. The skitter data can also be used to visualize the directed graph from a source to much of the Internet with their Otter tool. Otter can handle visualization tasks for a wide variety of Internet data, including data sets on topology, workload, performance, and routing. Caida has written many more tools to collect, analyze and visualize data, for example CoralReef and Walrus. VU/ GLOBE project The GLOBE project of the VU is a novel scalable infrastructure for a massive worldwide distributed system. I worked on GLOBE by writing an application called Loc8 which is able to locate users over the internet using the GLOBE system. Results The results of the exchange are that the VU now has a GLOBE service running in San Diego at caida and we will install a skitter machine at the VU to help caida do their analyses on the internet. The GLOBE machine in San Diego will give us more insight in the behaviours at long distances and will provide a better real world test case. The skitter machines at the VU will provide caida with data of the internet as seen from Amsterdam. As GLOBE matures we can use caida's data to find the best locations for our GLOBE boxes to provide a good service coverage and their data on bandwidth and round trip time etc. will help us to optimize GLOBE. Future Future projects at caida include the integration of bandwith estimation data into a database with Otter and/or Walrus as a front end. The data will be collected by a tool suite called netchar which uses features from Bruce Mah's pchar, Allen Downey's clink, and Constantinos Dovrolis' pathrate. The data processing back end refines and extends capabilities in Allen Downey's clink, and will assemble a view of the subnets connecting the hosts and estimates the bandwidth and latency of each link appearing in a path. Finally, the graphical user interface will layout the graph generated by the back end and allow the user to drill down into the collected data and estimated characteristics. Working at caida The commute to work took about 40 minutes of which 20 minutes walking and 20 minutes by bus. Riding the bus was free because students could ride free in a limited area around the UCSD campus. Caida has no strict hours so that gave me the abillity to avoid rush hours by going in later and leaving later. The office I worked in I shared with many co-workers (called elves). Some of them would already be there when I came in and some came in later. The office (called the elf/bin) is also shared with a couple of students working for caida and they came in whenever their classes allowed them to. Because the other co-workers worked in different offices, instead of having to walk to their offices, we used a communication system called the 'moo'. The moo is like a chat-room application on which you can type your questions to people or announce other things. We had meetings twice a week.

{"description":"Dynamically Loadable Zones in BIND v9 By Robert Butler Despite the advances of the Internet, management of DNS servers is still very rudimentary. DNS data continues to be stored in cryptic zone files. To make modifications to DNS data or add zones, administrators must edit the configuration files and then interrupt BIND's operation by issuing a restart, reload, or reconfig control message or command. If BIND requires many rapid zone or data modifications, it cannot perform its main function of serving DNS data because of constant interruption. This problem is exacerbated when BIND has a large amount of DNS data. Because BIND reads this data into memory, it can require huge amounts of ram, special kernel modifications, and long start or reload times. To solve these problems, several attempts have been made to mate DNS servers with more advanced backends to provide easier management of DNS data, especially if that data is dynamic in nature. Some attempts have resulted in new implementations of DNS servers. Other attempts have led to unsupported patches to existing DNS servers. Most of these efforts have ended in proprietary, unsupported, or unstable code. This forces those who desire to mate a DNS server with another backend to start again and develop a new proprietary system. BIND version 9 made efforts towards solving this problem by providing a database API. The idea behind this was that different database backends could be substituted for BIND's default in memory database. Additional efforts on this front yielded the SDB (Simple Database) API. This extended upon BIND's database API and converted all data into and out of BIND to ASCII text. This made the job of developing database drivers much easier because DNS data could be manipulated as text. However, BIND&nbsp;9 misses the mark and falls short in two areas. First, the supplied drivers are not production grade and should not be used in any critical system. Second, and more importantly, the current interface does not allow zone lookup. Zones must still be specified in the named.conf file, forcing the administrator to restart, reload, or reconfig the server for the changes to take effect. BIND DLZ makes an effort to eliminate these problems and hopefully simplify DNS data management. BIND DLZ (Dynamically Loadable Zones) is built upon BIND's database API. Actually, DLZ wraps BIND's database API inside of a new API. The new API allows BIND to ask (via a DLZ driver) if a zone is contained within the database. This allows zones and the records within a zone to both be stored in a single database. When combined with a true database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, this change has a dramatic effect on how BIND operates and how DNS data is managed. Because all zone and zone records are stored in a database system, cryptic zone files are no longer needed. Adding or removing zones from BIND does not require interrupting its operation; just add or remove a row in the database. BIND's memory requirements are minimized, as is the time required to for it to start. Unfortunately, DLZ is not a panacea for DNS data management. Because of BIND's internal design, DLZ has some serious limitations. At this time, BIND DLZ can support standard name resolution queries and zone transfers (AXFR). It cannot support incremental zone transfer (IXFR) or dynamic DNS updates as specified in RFC 2136. However, DLZ does not impede any of BIND's original functionality when using \"standard\" zone files. Standard zone files can be used for zones requiring incremental transfers or RFC 2136 dynamic updates alongside zones using DLZ. DLZ operates in a similar manner to BIND's existing interface. It has functions to load and unload itself and provides the new functions findzone() and allowzonexfr(). These new functions are responsible for querying the external database driver about the zones that it supports. Drivers that implement the DLZ interface must also implement BIND's existing database interface so that","url":"/project/bind-dlz/200205-sane/paper.html","title":"Dynamically Loadable Zones in BIND v9"},

This year the leading open source developers from the KDE community were joined by senior technical staff member representatives from Intel and IBM for a day of seminars and technical talks on the many facets of software development opportunities enabled by the new ISO/IEC 263000 (OpenDocument Format) international standard. Dr. Barbara Held, presently serving as Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General of the European Commission Program for Interchange of Data between Administrations (IDA), stated in her keynote address, \"In the view of the European administrations and Member States, the ODF standard is at the very top of the pile by far from all other proposed open standards.\" The Interoperable Delivery of pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (IDABC) promotes open document formats for European eGovernement services. The European administrations require accessibility, sustainability, independence, and scalability of document solutions. Open Document Format (ODF) is not just a file format for personal productivity application suites such as OpenOffice, Koffice, or IBM Workplace. The power of ODF is that any open source and/or commercial software application can generate ODF document data and when combined with other applications that implement ODF support, deliver new business value in highly collaborative and interoperable solutions. The promotion of the ISO/IEC 26300 Open Document Format standard in public administrations is part of the IDA and IDABC activities in support of pan-European interoperability. The initiative urges the industry to provide applications based on open formats that will allow electronic documents to be exchanged among authorities, and between authorities, citizens and business in a way that does not mandate the use of specific software products and ensures universal consumability of document data across these many application instances. The KDE office suite, Koffice, is an important proof point that demonstrates that the ODF standard can be implemented by more than one office suite. A true open standard is not a standard when implemented by only one application. Many ODF software solutions are listed at Wiki/OpenDocument. The developers attending the ODF Day at aKademy set their sights outside of the traditional well known office suite domain to discuss and plan a wide variety of new projects based on ODF XML. At the global KDE conference, Rob Weir from IBM presented a proposal to create an OpenDocument Developer Kit (ODDK) including an ODF API that will expose a higher level abstraction of ODF for application developers. The ODDK will help developers quickly become productive with ODF without having to master the underlying XML specification. The ODF standard represents a portable document data format that will drive innovation in applications that generate, filter, convert, augment, view, or analyze documents and the data contained within. Rob Weir, an OASIS ODF Technical Committee member and IBM software architect, said, \"ODF XML and related Internet and open standard technologies will lead to a golden age of document processing, both client and server side, with innovation driving new value for government and industrial enterprises.\" During ODF Day, the developer community gave consideration to several ODF usage models as prime opportunities to leverage ODF as a portable document format: see ODF/Models.

{"description":"BIND&nbsp;9 Dynamically Loadable Zone (DLZ) Project Plan Objectives: To add capabilities to BIND&nbsp;9 that will allow BIND backend databases to support adding and removing zones without interrupting normal server operation. History: This project began because of a personal need. A larger personal project of my own requires the ability to dynamically add and remove zones from a running DNS server without the downtime associated with zone reloads, restarts etc. I investigated several DNS server implementations (DJB DNS, Dents, DNS Java, etc) and found them all lacking or unsuitable for one reason or another. I finally began investigating BIND&nbsp;9. During the course of investigating BIND&nbsp;9, I posted several messages to the BIND9-workers mailing list. My messages to the mailing list caught the attention of Teus Hagen, chairman and general director of NLnet. NLnet is a non-profit organization committed to network (Internet) related research and development. As part of this commitment, they sponsor the development of software that would benefit the Internet and make that software available as open source. Teus posed an interesting proposition: NLnet would sponsor (fund) the development of this capability in BIND&nbsp;9 if I made its results open source and available to the world. The result of this proposition is this project. Requirements: It will be open source. Open source designates software for which the source is freely available for reuse. For the definition, see http://www.opensource.org here. This is an essential condition of funding, as the NLnet Foundation supports network software projects that are open for reuse. The source will be released under a BSD style license. It will use / re-use the existing BIND&nbsp;9 database interface. BIND&nbsp;9 already has a database interface to support DNS record lookup in an external database. There is no need to replicate this functionality, and we can simply make use of it. It will not modify the existing BIND&nbsp;9 database interface. BIND uses the existing interface for the default in memory database. If we caused modification to the existing database interface, it would require even more changes to BIND\\x92s existing code base. This would require even more development effort and debugging. Since it is possible to add the functionality we need to BIND without modifying this interface, we should do so. Also, minimizing the changes to BIND\\x92s existing code will make our changes even more likely to be merged into BIND's core. It will be merged into BIND&nbsp;9 public source. The goal of this project is to develop code that will improve BIND's functionality. Ideally, these changes will become part of BIND&nbsp;9 and not need to be maintained as a separate patch. To that end, source code enhancements will always attempt to follow the current BIND&nbsp;9 coding style and standard. However, we cannot guarantee that our modifications will become part of BIND. Therefore, this is not a requirement of funding because it is out of our control. The best we can do is to develop the code and present it for inclusion into BIND&nbsp;9. (Optional) If possible, drivers should allow \"dual mode\" use. Since the database drivers will be re-using the existing BIND database interface, it should be possible to have the driver operate in \"two modes\". Mode 1 would support the current BIND database interface without any extensions. Mode 2 would support our extended interface. This would eliminate the need to duplicate any effort between a dynamically loadable zone driver and a standard BIND database driver. This capability needs to be investigated further and is not a requirement of funding. By supporting two modes of operation, BIND administrators can choose to implement the full functionality of the driver and gain support for dynamically loaded zones, or only use a portion of the driver\\x92s ability and reduce the overhead involved with looking up a zone (By using BIND\\x92s existing in memory","url":"/project/bind-dlz/phase1/200112-plan.html","title":"BIND&nbsp;9 Dynamically Loadable Zone (DLZ) Project Plan"},

It will use the new DLZ/SDLZ database interface developed in phase&nbsp;1. DLZ added a new interface to BIND 9 to allow zones to be looked up in an external database. This capability was used in the development of a PostgreSQL driver in Phase 1 of the DLZ project. It may modify the existing DLZ/SDLZ database interface. The interface developed in Phase 1 of the DLZ project is still subject to modification. It was built and designed to allow nearly any driver to be developed for use with DLZ. However, if an error or limitation of DLZ is found, then phase&nbsp;2 may modify the DLZ interface to fix an error or remove a limitation. It will be merged into BIND 9 public source.

So this is not a requirement of funding because it is out of our control. The best we can do is to develop the code and present it for inclusion into BIND 9. To the extent possible, the drivers should support multiple operating systems. This will be limited to the developer's ability to test the drivers on multiple operating systems. However, every effort should be made to allow the drivers to operate on any system that the database it supports operates on. Dynamically loadable zone drivers may only implement limited functionality. DLZ provides an interface to allow domain name lookups and full zone transfers (not incremental zone transfers). To the extent possible, all drivers developed as part of this project will implement and provide full DLZ capabilities. However, some drivers may not be able to provide zone transfer capabilities because of a limitation of the database backend or something similar. It will be properly documented for both users and future developers. Good documentation is essential for everyone. Unfortunately, BIND 9's source is not very well documented, and that makes understanding the code and modifications to it difficult. The modifications to BIND in phase&nbsp;1 of DLZ were documented in the source as code comments in an effort to allow future developers to understand what is going on.

{"description":"Atom-Based Routing; Practical Deployment 5. Practical Deployment of Atom-Based Routing This section shows two ways of incrementally deploying atom-based routing in the current Internet. The approaches discussed share the following properties: They affect only cooperating routers in the backbone. They are transparent to other backbone routers, as well as to routers outside the backbone. The protocols used are based on existing routing and forwarding protocols, with only minor modifications. Neither approach addresses atom computation. Instead they simply assume that the problem of scalable atom computation has been solved. In Section&nbsp; 5.3 we briefly discuss a number of issues pertaining to atom computation. 5.1. Atom-Based Routing Islands Here we show how to embed an `island' of atom-based routing in the backbone. Routers that are part of such an island reap the benefits of atom-based routing. On the other hand, outside the island the application of atom-based routing is completely transparent (apart from observed performance). By introducing an island of atom-based routing, and gradually growing it, it is possible to effect a gradual transition to an `atomised' Internet backbone. The aproach described here extends BGP, and uses IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6 addresses) to represent atom ids. The aproach has the following properties (see Section&nbsp; 4.1 ): Scope of atoms The scope of each atom is the entire island of atom-based routing. Note that a more sophisticated version might divide an island into more than one scope for scalability. Knowledge of prefixes This aproach does not require each router to be aware of all prefixes. Only a subset of the routers are; others are only aware of atoms without knowing what prefixes they consist of. The aproach distinguishes the following routers: External routers, which are outside the island. These routers are not aware of the atom-based routing protocol. Internal routers, which are within the island. Internal routers are further divided into edge routers and transit routers. Edge routers which are internal routers that exchange (forward) packets with external and internal routers. Transit routers which are internal routers that merely exchange (forward) packets with other internal routers. The internal routers implement routing and forwarding in three parts: Atom computation: As mentioned earlier, the problem of atom computation is assumed to have been solved. We assume the outcome of the computation is a collectively agreed upon atom id for each atom, and a mapping between atom identifiers and the prefixes atoms consist of. Only edge routers need to be aware of this mapping; transit routers do not. &nbsp; Updates to the routing of atoms: Routing update messages are exchanged between all internal routers (both edge and transit routers). This part of the approach uses BGP. But whereas normally BGP carries reachability information for individual prefixes, here we use BGP to announce reachability information for atom ids. Since an atom id is just an IP address, regular BGP can be used. Alternatively, the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of BGP RFC2283 can be used to carry this information if we view atom ids as an address family. &nbsp; Forwarding of packets: A packet is accepted by an edge router from an external router. Based on the destination IP address of the packet, the edge router tags the packet with the correct atom id. Based on the atom id, the packet is then forwarded by the system of internal routers (transit and edge routers) until it reaches the edge router where it leaves the island. This edge router removes the atom id tag and forwards the packet to an external router. One way of implementing this is to `source route' the packet: At the edge router where the packet enters the island, an IPv4 loose source route option RFC791 is added to the packet. If the packet already contains a source route option, the source route option is modified instead. The packet is source-routed","title":"Atom-Based Routing; Practical Deployment","url":"/project/atombr/200207-plan/5.html"},
{"description":"Atom-Based Routing; Planning 8. Planning First three months --- A Basic Atom-Based Router In the first three months a basic atom-based router is implemented. This router is based on allocated atoms (Section&nbsp; 7.1 ). The work of the first period is carried out in the following steps: Refining and Releasing Atom Computation Scripts To get Patrick Verkaik started, we begin with documenting Andre Broido's existing Perl scripts for atom computation. These scripts are subsequently released. Implement Basic Atom-Based Router Next, we implement a basic atom-based router. The router is designed to work in the framework of Section&nbsp; 5.1, and can function as a transit or edge router. It uses existing router code (such as gated ) wherever possible. Atoms are not yet computed; they are allocated (Section&nbsp; 7.1 ), since allocated atoms are more easily implemented. Release We release the implementation. Next three months --- Advanced Atom-Based Router In the next three months an advanced atom-based router is implemented. In particular atom computation will be addressed. The following steps are taken: Refine Atom Computation We review the above atom computation scripts with the aim of finding a scalable, realtime algorithm to compute atoms. One possible outcome is that atoms are initially computed as in the scripts (i.e. centralised and offline), but subsequently updated in a scalable, realtime way. The improved algorithm is implemented, and incorporated into the atom-based router. Evaluation We measure and evaluate the resulting atom-based router, comparing it to a standard BGP router. This could be done using an SSFnet simulation, with RouteViews as a data source to feed the simulation. Release We release the implementation. Notes: We intend to have experts looking over our shoulders from the start. Note that Tony Li (Procket Networks), Dave Ward (Cisco Systems), Curtis Villamizar (Avici Systems) and Dennis Ferguson (Juniper Networks) have already expressed interest. In this way we hope to have the results put to practical use for the benefit of the Internet community. Unfortunately, the precise start date remains unknown at this time, and depends on issues such as VISA application. We aim to get started at the beginning of September. For Patrick Verkaik to attend the workshop in Leiden in October, we would like Patrick to work from The Netherlands until the workshop, and to fly to San Diego after the workshop. The remainder of his six months will be carried out in San Diego. The planning above does not take into account vacation time. Four months into the project we review whether there should be an extension of another six months (Section&nbsp; 8.1 ). 8.1. Extension Provided the outcome of the first six months is agreeable to all parties, we hope to extend the project for another six months. Ideas for the next six months are: Applying the atom concept to other domains. We expect atoms and our implementations to be applicable to other domains such as overlay networks (e.g. Peer-to-Peer and Ad-Hoc networks). Publishing the results. Creating specifications of the protocols that were derived or modified during the first six months. This involves removing any hacks (use of inappropriate or reserved IP header fields for example). The specification can be the basis of an RFC. Next: 9. Project Members","title":"Atom-Based Routing; Planning","url":"/project/atombr/200207-plan/8.html"},
{"description":"Atom-Based Routing; Answers to Questions 6. Answers to Questions 6.1. What about IP Version 6? At the moment, applicability of atom-based routing to IPv6 is an open-ended question. The routing architecture for IPv6 is not well-defined. If, as seems likely, momentum or inertia is the rule, then the IPv6 routing architecture will be fundamentally similar to the IPv4 architecture (including CIDR and its limitations) and the results of this project will transpose cleanly. IPv6 does introduce a more structured allocation of addresses, apparently intended to allow better aggregation. However under CIDR, multihomed ASes will still introduce prefixes that their providers cannot aggregate (Section&nbsp; 2.3 ). Also, current engineering tactics (such as load balancing across prefixes) will still be prevalent in an IPv6 world. In addition, the increased length of IPv6 addresses will have a negative effect on router table size, and on the complexity of (distributed) computations. However, the combination of atoms and IPv6 produces the interesting idea of placing an atom id in IPv6 addresses (at the time of allocation of the address). Routers would not need to maintain an explicit mapping between atoms and address prefixes covering such addresses. The number of entries in the tables covering such addresses would be equal to the number of atoms rather than the number of prefixes (which is substantially less). Although the address format of an IPv6 address has pretty much been defined, if an implementation of atoms were done and proved successful, there would be motivation for the IETF to look again at the address bits and the way that they are allocated, and perhaps carve out some for an atom id. 6.2. Who Benefits from Atom-Based Routing? Keeping the Internet backbone routing tables small is beneficial to all users of the Internet. It will help reduce the cost of the infrastructure, simplify the hardware technology that must be deployed and generally lengthen the life of the Internet address space. 6.2.1. Current Growth The one thing everyone agrees on is that growth continues. Had it been left unchecked (e.g. by CIDR, controls by registry allocation and provider annoucement policies), it would have already quickly outstripped Moore's law. Even now, with checks in place, growth is uncomfortably fast, since providers have to continually upgrade memory sizes and processors in Internet backbone routers. `Coping' in this way is not a good strategy and bears considerable long term risk. 6.2.2. Future Growth The most recent backbone routers are within a factor of four of the most current processor clock rates and will continue to close quickly. However, the microprocessor industry is less motivated to develop faster processors as the desktop PC demand curve has flattened. If microcomputer industry continues to slow, router industry may actually have to drive the computing industry or have to use multiprocessor computers just to process the control plane. Neither is an appealing prospect, either from a technology point of view or from a robustness perspective. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the router industry will be able to drive the computing industry: not even the entire router market is large enough to sway the microprocessor industry to accelerate R&amp;D sufficiently. 6.3. Aren't Routing Vendors Tackling these Problems? The ability to advertise multiple prefixes with common attributes as part of a single BGP update message is a known capability and is not overly difficult. However, the further ability to take that set of prefixes and perform some form of proxy aggregation is not currently a well-understood capability. This functionality would have great returns as it would decrease the prefix loading behind the domain that is performing the atomicity/aggregation computations. A key point to remember is that today, many domains advertise unnecessarily specific prefixes to effect the optimal local routing policy.

{"description":"Project Summery Exchange VU&nbsp;-&nbsp;CAIDA (October 2000 - May 2001) My first assignment was to map reverse-traceroute [1] and looking glass servers [2] onto a world map. Using internet search engines and e-mails send by people maintaining reverse-traceroute and looking glass servers, I collected as many reverse-traceroute and looking glass pages as I could. Using their IP address and NetGeo [3] I could find their latitude and longitude as well as city, state and country. With this information I then used GeoPlot [4] to display the servers onto a world map. The servers appear as little dots on the map and clicking on them will bring up a page containing the urls for the traceroute and looking glass servers for that node or zoom in to that particular region. The nodes are colored to indicate what services are available for that location. Because these pages need to be maintained I wrote a program that will check if the pages in the database still exist and parse their contents to find out if the page provides traceroute and/or looking glass services. With the new database all the HTML-pages are generated/updated automatically. The next thing I did was to collect the AS numbers for all the traceroute and looking glass pages (again using NetGeo) and build a web page that allows users to search our database for traceroute and looking glass servers by AS number. This page also allows users to search by, AS-name, latitude, longitude, city, state, country, having a traceroute service and/or having a looking glass service. The purpose of these pages is to give users with network problems the ability to find the nearest traceroute/looking glass service in a convenient way based on the location they desire to trace from. The traceroute/looking glass services can then be used to view their own network and can provide hints to what causes their networking problem. Image of worldview. Larger 1098&nbsp;x&nbsp;637 The second assignment was to update the web pages that provide users with daily summaries of data collected by the skitter boxes around the world. I first had to familiarize myself with the way the scripts currently processed the data for web usage before I was able to expand their web pages. In particular, I added pie charts to display the percentage of paths going through a particular country or AS. Because a user can select multiple skitter boxes and dates to generate this pie chart, I had to merge the data of the skitter boxes and dates before I could generate the pie charts. I first implemented this task in Perl, but due to speed limitations I ported it to C (for 50X speed improvement). The selection of dates and servers from the web page was not very user friendly because not all servers had valid data for all days. The user had to consult a list of servers next to each date to see if a particular server had data for that date. Using Javascript, I changed the selection part so that when the users selects a given skitter box, the date menu is updated to contain only those dates that that skitter box has data. Conversely, clicking on a date will trigger the server menu to only list those servers with data available for the selected date(s). It was incredibly tediously difficult to get this functionality to work for most browsers/platforms out there. I also added AS connectivity graph images to the web pages. An AS graph image shows a graph with AS nodes arranged in a circle with polar coordinates, with their angle based on the location of their AS headquarters and their distance from the center reflecting the richness of their observed connectivity to other ASes. Those nodes closest to the center are the most connected ASes as observed for those particular days and skitter boxes. The graph is drawn by a visualization tool called Otter [5]. Users can download a data file for Otter that allows the user to view the graph on their own machine with more detail. Image of pie chart.

{"description":"Ad\\xADhoc Localization of Wireless Sensor Nodes Research Exchange (ReX) Program Update Koen Langendoen Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands This summer I worked for three months at the Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC) as a visiting research scholar in the PicoRadio project. This visit was sponsored by a grant from the USENIX association and stichting NLnet (ReX program). Working at the BWRC was a great opportunity for me to get a hands\\xAD on introduction into the rapidly evolving field of wireless sensor networks. The knowledge, skills, and research contacts acquired during my stay at the BWRC will be of great help in my new job as assistant professor at Delft University of Technology. PicoRadio The PicoRadio group at UC Berkeley is addressing the technological possibilities to integrate sensors, an embedded processor, a wireless link, and a power supply into a single small device. The target is to have operational sensor nodes by December 2002. Networks of wireless sensors can be used for a wide range of monitoring &amp; control applications, for example, temperature control for office spaces, climate control for greenhouses, and security of buildings. To ease the development of (commercial) applications it is of great importance that wireless sensor networks are (largely) self\\xADconfiguring; with as little infrastructure as possible sensor nodes should become aware of their environment and start communicating and collaborating with neighbors to carry out the specific task at hand. System software (e.g., routing and location discovery) is needed to support self\\xADorganizing applications on wireless sensor networks. Ad\\xADhoc localization During my stay at the BWRC I focused on the problem of determining the location of the individual nodes in an ad\\xADhoc sensor network. Knowing the location of a sensor node is required to answer questions like \"what is the temperature in the kitchen?\", and for implementing efficient routing protocols (the energy required to communicate between nodes grows quadratically with the distance). We assume that a small fraction (&lt;10%) of anchor nodes know their location, for example, because they are equipped with an additional GPS receiver. The remaining nodes should then estimate their location using distance measurements to their neighbors. Within the PicoRadio project we use a 2\\xADphase approach. First, the nodes compute a rough estimate based on the topology of the network; counting the number of hops to different anchors indicates a rough region of possible locations. Second, nodes refine their locations in a number of iterations involving multilateration. Knowing the distances to 3 reference points suffices to determine the location of a node (3\\xADlateration). Additional reference points, however, are needed to cope with errors in the distance measurements. The iterative refinement method raises two questions: 1) does the procedure converge?, and 2) how accurate are the estimated locations? Initial experiments with a discrete event simulator showed that even with perfect information (i.e., distance measurements without errors) very poor locations resulted in many cases. I was able to identify two essential causes: Bad topology. Nodes with too few connections (&lt;3) to reference points cannot be properly located. Likewise, sets of nodes with too few \"external\" connections cannot be located. I developed an ad\\xADhoc rule to identify such cases. Error propagation. It is of critical importance to limit the effects of poor location estimates since in iterations the whole network is infected, where d is the network diameter. Our solution to the above problems is to associate a confidence (a factor between 0 and 1) with each location estimate and weigh the information passed to the multilateration procedure. Results and future work Using confidence factors improved both the number of cases that converge as well as the accuracy of the individual locations.
